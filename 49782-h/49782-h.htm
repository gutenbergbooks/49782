“forty times forty churches,”&mdash;Russian serfs tilled the corn-fields
of their lords, trembled beneath the knout and the plitt,
ate their kasha and drank their kvass, and enjoyed the simple
luxuries of their stoves and their vapour-baths, just as their
fathers and fathers’ fathers had done for generations.</p>

<p>In that land of sameness, where received types repeat each
other to weariness, with almost as little variety in the works
of nature as originality in those of man, the village of Nicolofsky
was a fair sample of a hundred others. It belonged to
Plato Zoubof, one of the favourites of Catherine II., who had
bestowed it upon him with the adjacent lands and the “bodies
and souls of men” it contained. Out of these he contrived to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
wring no inconsiderable revenue; but he never honoured Nicolofsky
with his presence. A steward managed everything,
unfortunately for the peasants, or mujiks, who were treated
with much more severity than their brethren whose natural
lords dwelt “among their own people,” and cultivated relations
with them usually kindly, often even paternal. From the
mujiks of Nicolofsky heavy dues were exacted, and much
labour required in the corn-fields of their lord. In harvest-time
they were often forced to toil the whole night long, and
any shortcoming was cruelly punished. At this very epoch
a series of enlightened enactments, tending to ameliorate the
lot of the serf and to prepare the way for his complete emancipation,
were emanating from the supreme authority in the
state; but from these Nicolofsky had as yet received little or
no practical benefit, except, indeed, the deep conviction, which
sank into the heart of the mujik, that his lord the Czar loved
him and cared for his welfare.</p>

<p>Still, as the proverb tells us, “The holy Russian land is
large, but everywhere the dear sun shines.” Many a gleam of
sunlight, from the mercy of Him whose compassions are over
all his works, brightens even the lot of servitude, that looks,
and rightly looks, so dark and so degrading to the thoughtful
observer. Had such an observer visited Nicolofsky on the
bright afternoon of one of the Church holidays in the late
Russian spring, he would have found some difficulty in remembering,
and perhaps as much in persuading the mujiks, that
they were an oppressed and miserable race.</p>

<p>Youths and maidens, boys and girls were crowding to the
birch-wood to enjoy their favourite pastime of the swing. Nor
were the older villagers unrepresented&mdash;at least so far as
regards the men. Many a grave, bearded mujik keenly
enjoyed the motion without labour so dear to the indolent and
excitable Russian, although the women for the most part
remained at home to prepare the tschi (or cabbage soup)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
for the festive evening meal. The young people, as they
passed along, made the air resound with their sweet national
songs, chanted in parts and with wonderful grace and harmony.</p>

<p>The company of children seemed to follow the guidance of
one of their number, whom either his position or the choice of
his companions had made a leader amongst them. At twelve
or fourteen the little mujik is often a very handsome lad, as
may be seen from the boy postilions of St. Petersburg. And a
most favourable specimen of the class, if indeed he belonged to
it at all, was the fair-haired boy who stepped so proudly along,
quite conscious of his superior dignity, and conspicuous in his
new caftan of bright blue, bound round the waist with a crimson
sash. He held by the hand a little girl, very pretty, though
not so gaily clad. She seemed to be his especial charge; and
when the spot in the wood where they meant to pursue their
sport was reached at last, the other children crowded around
them, and, like juvenile courtiers, emulously tendered their
help to make a swing for “Barrinka,” the little lord, who had
promised to swing Anna “Popovna,” the priest’s daughter.
These swings were made very easily, by bending down and
tying together the flexible elastic branches of the giant
birches.</p>

<p>Barrinka, however, wanted to do all himself, and he did it
quickly and neatly. He had just, with boyish gallantry, placed
his little companion in the seat prepared for her, when an older
lad pushed rudely through the group of children, and coming
up to him laid his hand on his shoulder. “Get into that seat
and swing yourself, Ivan Barrinka,” he said. “To-day Anna
Popovna belongs to me&mdash;not to you.”</p>

<p>Ivan shook off his hand, and for a moment they stood motionless,
looking each other in the face. Strong was the contrast
between the fine, delicate features of the one, and the rough,
dogged, determined face of the other, which seemed hewn out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
of his native granite. Evidently this was not by any means
their first quarrel.</p>

<p>“Hold thy peace, one-eared Michael,” Ivan answered at last.
“I tell thee Anna wants me to swing her&mdash;<em>me</em>, and not thee.”</p>

<p>“Let her say so, then.&mdash;Is that true, Anna Popovna? Didst
thou not promise me yesterday, after church, that I should
swing thee to-day&mdash;I, and no one else?”</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, the little girl behaved very like a grown-up
daughter of Eve. She pouted, blushed, stammered, and seemed
to hesitate between her two cavaliers, neither of whom she
wished to offend. At length she said, “If you wanted so
much to swing me, why were you not here in time, Michael
Ivanovitch?”</p>

<p>“Easy for those who have naught to do to blame those who
work hard. I had water to fetch and wood to cut for the
mother,” said Michael, the widow’s son.</p>

<p>“Well, it was a pity, since you stayed away so long, that
you did not stay altogether, and leave us in peace,” Anna
rejoined in a pettish tone.</p>

<p>This exasperated Michael, and not without reason, if all were
told. “You did not say that to me, Anna Popovna,” he cried,
“when I went to seek you in the snowstorm, you and your
brother the Popovitch, and lost my left ear to save you.” Then
he turned fiercely upon Ivan, as upon a foe more worthy of his
wrath: “It is all your fault, Ivan Barrinka. I am quite tired
of you and of your pride. Lord though you may be, you shall
not lord it over me. And, after all, who knows who and
what you are? I’m sure I don’t. Do you know yourself?
Answer me that. Whose son are you?”</p>

<p>“It is you who are proud, Michael Ivanovitch. Since that
wonderful snowstorm you were out in there has been no bearing
with you. One would think, from the airs you give yourself,
that no one ever had an ear frozen before.”</p>

<p>By this time the loud voices had attracted the attention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
the other boys. Leaving their swings, they came crowding
around; and as soon as they understood the cause of the dispute,
they all turned with one accord upon Michael, threatening him
with condign punishment if he did not forthwith let Barrinka
have his way, whatever that way might be.</p>

<p>But Barrinka no longer cared for the pastime. Michael’s
taunt, “Who knows who and what you are?” had struck home.
From infancy the pet and plaything of the village&mdash;every wish
anticipated, every caprice borne with, he had been surrounded
with an atmosphere of deferential affection. He could not but
know that he differed from all around him; a mystery hung
about his birth, which, through injudicious and mistaken kindness,
had been neither wholly concealed nor yet frankly
revealed to him. All his little playfellows had fathers and
mothers. It is true they were beaten sometimes, while <em>he</em> was
never beaten. Still, it seemed to him a strange thing to have
no father or mother. He called the starost, or elder of the
village, in whose house he had been brought up, “bativshka”
(little father), and his wife, “mativshka” (little mother), but
that was not by any means the same as having a father and
mother of his own.</p>

<p>“Take the swing if you like it,” he said to Michael. “I
care nothing about it. I shall do something by-and-by much
better than anything you have ever done in your life.”</p>

<p>Leaving the children behind him in the wood, he bent his
steps homeward, regardless of the regretful looks sent after him
by blue-eyed Anna Popovna, who saw that her little cavalier
was sorely vexed, and would gladly have comforted him. Two
longings filled his childish heart,&mdash;to be able to tell Michael and
everybody who he was, and to be the hero of an adventure
more wonderful than Michael’s wanderings through the snow
in search of the priest’s children. Michael had been out in a
snowstorm and lost an ear! In comparison with such a hero
the little lord felt himself a very child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
He soon came in sight of the double row of brown wooden
cottages that called itself Nicolofsky. These cottages, or izbas,
were built of the trunks of trees laid one over the other, with
the interstices stuffed with moss. There was a church, also
of wood, but larger and better built, with a bell suspended
from a fine elm tree close to it. Two of the izbas were
better than the rest, and belonged, one to the starost, the other
to the pope, or parish priest, Anna’s father. That of the starost
boasted a porch, with ornamental wooden pillars and quaint
carvings. It had a substantial chimney built of good bricks,
and secure well-glazed windows to keep out the intense cold of
the Russian winter. Indeed all the cottages were more comfortable
than they looked.</p>

<p>Ivan entered, and dutifully made his bow, as he had been
taught to do, to the holy picture which hung in the corner, with
a lamp burning before it, since this was a feast-day. The contents
of the izba were extremely simple. The most conspicuous
object was the stove, with a wide shelf or platform over it, upon
which the family usually slept; a handsome carved chest contained
the clothing used upon festive occasions, and there were
besides a few stools, a table, an arm-chair, and some wooden
cups, platters, and cooking utensils. The vapour-bath, that
indispensable Russian luxury, occupied an outhouse.</p>

<p>An old woman stood over the fire, diligently stirring a capacious
caldron, from which there issued a very savoury steam.
The family the starost had to feed was not a small one,&mdash;three
grown-up sons, with the wife and child of one of them, found
shelter beneath his roof.</p>

<p>“You are cooking tschi for our supper, mativshka,” said Ivan.</p>

<p>“And what better dish could I be cooking, my little dove?
‘For tschi, folk wed,’ says the proverb.”</p>

<p>“When I am old enough I will wed Anna Popovna.”</p>

<p>“Hush! hush! My darling must not talk so. He is worth
a thousand Popovnas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
“One-eared Michael does not think that.”</p>

<p>“Who cares for one-eared Michael?”</p>

<p>“But, mativshka, to-day he asked me who I was, and I&mdash;I
had no answer.”</p>

<p>“No answer! Why, every one knows who you are. You
are our dear little lord.”</p>

<p>“But whose son am I, mativshka? That was what he
wanted to know.”</p>

<p>“Ask the father, boy, ask the father. As for me, why,
‘A word is not a bird: if it flies out, you’ll never catch it
again.’”</p>

<p>Old Feodora would not have thought it any harm to put her
nursling off with a string of falsehoods, if they had occurred to
her at the moment, or if she had thought them necessary; for
these poor, “dimly-lighted souls” had little idea of the value of
truth. But Ivan’s history was now so much an “open secret”
in the village, that she saw no reason why the boy should not
know it himself, since he was twelve years old, and very intelligent.
Still, she was afraid to tell him anything without her
husband’s knowledge and concurrence.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the starost came in&mdash;an imposing and venerable
figure, his long, gray beard nearly covering the breast of
his caftan. He would have parted with his head quite as
readily as with that beard.</p>

<p>As soon as he had made his reverence to the sacred picture,
seated himself in his chair by the stove, and exchanged his
formidable (and fragrant) boots of Russia leather for a pair of
lapti, or bark slippers, Ivan stood up before him, and put the
question directly, “Bativshka, whose son am I?”</p>

<p>“Great St. Nicholas! what has come to the boy?” the starost
exclaimed; then he looked perplexed, and hesitated for an
answer. His wife leaned over the back of his chair and said
a few words in a low voice, and a whispered discussion followed,
during which Ivan waited patiently. Presently Feodora<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
returned to her cooking; and the starost solemnly crossed
his breast with the thumb and two fingers of his right hand,
then taking from his pocket a medal with the effigy of his
patron saint upon it, he brightened it with a rub against his
sleeve, and said a prayer to it, or to the personage it represented.
Having thus prepared himself, he told Ivan to sit down at his
feet.</p>

<p>“My child,” he said, “since you wish to know, I will tell
you to-day what name you have a right to bear; but pray to
your saint day and night that the knowledge may work you
no harm.”</p>

<p>“Why should it work me harm, bativshka? Is it that I am
the son of a bad man?”</p>

<p>“God only knows that. What I know is that you are the
son of our lord and master.”</p>

<p>“Not of Zoubof! no, no!” cried Ivan, wondering.</p>

<p>The old man replied by a gesture of supreme contempt:
“<em>Zoubof!</em> He is of yesterday. Such as he come and go and
are forgotten, like last year’s snow. But you, Ivan Barrinka,
you are the son of our true lord, our master in God’s sight&mdash;a
great boyar,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> a prince who can trace his lineage back to the
days of Rurik. Yes; you are the son of”&mdash;here he paused and
bowed his gray head reverently&mdash;“of Prince Pojarsky.”</p>

<p>Ivan was impressed by the solemn tone in which these words
were spoken. He waited in silence for a few moments, then he
questioned in a low voice, “And who is Prince Pojarsky?”</p>

<p>“He and his have been the lords of Nicolofsky and the lands
around it for generations and generations, even before the old
times when the Poles conquered Muscovy. But in the days of
the great Czarina Catherine, who rests with God, our lord and
your father, being a young man, full of pride and loving pleasure,
must needs go forth to travel in strange lands. For you
must know, Ivan Barrinka, that there are other lands in God’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
world besides holy Russia, and that the peoples thereof do not
obey our lord the Czar, but have kings and rulers of their own.
This is hard to believe; but Pope Nikita says so, and, moreover,
the soldiers tell us of them when they come back from the wars.
Besides, I have seen Nyemtzi<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> myself&mdash;Frenchmen and Frenchwomen,
who had not a word of good Russian, but spoke an outlandish
tongue of their own. What is sad to think, our lord and
your father not only went amongst these foreigners, but gave his
hand in marriage to one of them. Not that I have anything
to say against the beautiful, gracious lady, your mother. The
good saints rest her soul! Mativshka loved her well, and God
knows she served her faithfully. But amongst her kinsfolk
must have been some who were the devil’s children; for they
rose against their own king, and, horrible to tell! they slew
him. Moreover, they did not do it secretly and in darkness,
but openly, in the face of day, on a scaffold, as if he had been
a thief or a murderer. Truly they are strange people, those
Nyemtzi.</p>

<p>“Let us hope that evil men slandered our lord to the Czarina
when they said <em>he</em> bore part in such wickedness. But at all
events she believed the tale. When he came back to St. Petersburg,
and dared to show his face at the Hermitage (the great,
beautiful house where our lady the Czarina lived), she scathed
him with the lightning of her anger. It is even reported that
she said to him, ‘<em>Pachol!</em>’<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>&mdash;the word you would use to a dog
if you were angry with it. Straightway he was sent an exile to
Siberia, and all he had was taken from him and given to Plato
Zoubof. Better had they laid him in his grave at once. The
beautiful young lady, your mother, quickly died of grief,
and mativshka, who was your nurse, brought you home to her
own people. For a long time we hid you carefully, and
guarded the secret jealously amongst ourselves; for we feared
the new lord Plato Zoubof, and still more the steward Dmitri&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
hard man, who has no pity. But now both know you are
here, and care nothing for it. ‘What is it to us?’ they say.
So that now, without fear, you may call yourself, and be called
by every one, by the noble name you have a right to bear.
Only remember, Ivan Barrinka, that although you are the son
of a boyar and a prince, the same God made us and you, and
the poor man’s soul is worth as much in his sight as your
own.”</p>

<p>Ivan answered not a word. As one overpowered, he threw
himself face downwards on the earthen floor, and lay there
absorbed in thought. But at last he raised his wondering,
child-like face, full of the brightness of a new idea. “Bativshka,
people sometimes come back from Siberia, do they
not?”</p>

<p>The old man shook his head. “They who go are as the
sand,” he said; “they who come back may be reckoned on your
fingers.”</p>

<p>“But I remember the time of the Czar’s coronation&mdash;four&mdash;five
years ago, was it? I was quite a little boy then. Many
exiles came home from Siberia; and you went to the Moscow
road to see them pass, and the people wept for joy, you said.
I wanted to go, but you would not bring me, saying I was
too young. If these exiles came back, then why not my
father?”</p>

<p>“Ah, you cannot understand. That was quite another
matter. The late Czar, Paul Petrovitch, who reigned after the
Czarina Catherine, was somewhat stern and hard. Doubtless
God sent him to punish the great nobles for their sins. He
banished many of them to Siberia; but the Czar that now is,
whom God preserve! pardoned them all, and let them return
home. Yet some offences there be that find no pardon ever,
except in the grave;&mdash;and to the exile’s resting-place the grave
is always near.”</p>

<p>Ivan’s next thought was a more childish one. “Bativshka,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
he said, after another silence, “I should like to tell all this to
Anna Popovna and to Michael Ivanovitch. Still, although I
am the son of a boyar and a prince,” he added presently, “I
shall not be quite happy, not <em>quite</em>, until I have taken a longer
journey than ever Michael did, and have had something happen
to me much more wonderful than getting frozen and losing one
of my ears.”</p>

<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_i.jpg" width="73" height="72" alt="" />
<span class="smcap1 i">Ivan Barrinka</span>, or Ivan Pojarsky, as he may
now be called, was a genuine child of Russia. His
nature was quick, mobile, restless, passionate. He
was capable of strong determination, but capable
also of changefulness and inconstancy, because the mood of the
moment always seized upon and swayed his whole soul. But
he was all this only in the germ, for his was as yet the unawakened,
undeveloped mind of a child. The simple-hearted
guardians of his infancy had given him all they could&mdash;food,
shelter, and tenderness; and this not only without hope of reward,
but during some years under absolute terror of discovery
and punishment. But they could not give him the instruction
to which his intelligent mind would have so eagerly responded.
No one in the village, except the priest, knew the mysteries of
the Russian alphabet; and Pope Nikita, like most Russian
priests, was in no real sense a pastor or a teacher, but rather a
machine for performing the numerous ceremonies of his Church.
All that could be said in his favour was, that if he did little
good, he did little harm. Neither from him nor from the
starost did Ivan learn any religion except a series of outward
acts and postures, of bowings and crossings, and formal repetitions
of “Gospodin pomilvi,”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> with a respect for sacred pictures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
and a vague reverence for God, for the saints, and for
the Czar. He never dreamed that any of these mysterious,
far-away powers should influence his daily conduct, though he
did believe that his patron St. John (Ivan is the Russian form
of John) might help him in a time of need; because, when he
had the measles, a picture of the saint had been blessed by the
pope and laid on his breast, and straightway he began to recover!
It was mournfully significant of the kind of instruction
he received, that he had but one and the same word to designate
the divine Being and the “gods of silver and gods of gold” that
too often, in the popular estimation, usurped His place. If
any one had asked him, “Who made you?” he would have
answered, “Bog;” and had the question followed, “What is
that in the corner, before which the candle is burning?” he
would still have replied, without hesitation, “It is Bog.”</p>

<p>A few childish legends of the saints, a few stories of “kiki-noras”
or goblins, formed the staple of the “folk lore” that
circulated round the stove during the long winter evenings.
The Bible narratives, so familiar and so fascinating to the
English child, were almost unknown to Ivan; nor did exploits
of the heroes of his own country hold the place they sometimes
do on the lips or in the hearts of the people. Hence, when the
starost told him that he was himself the heir of one of the
noblest of Russian names, no answering chord resounded in his
heart. The revelation, that ought to have moved him so deeply,
failed of its due effect, because his ignorance did not supply the
background that was needed to throw it into relief. He had
always known that he was something other, something greater
than those around him; but beyond that he had no power of
measuring social distances. Princes, boyars, all who were not
mujiks, were alike to him; just as it seemed to him nearly the
same thing to go to the Moscow road, to Moscow itself, or even
to St. Petersburg. Therefore, after spending a little vague,
half-comprehending wonder upon the starost’s story, his mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
reverted, as days went on, to what was at this period his ruling
idea&mdash;the hope of rivalling and surpassing Michael in some deed
of daring, and consequently in the regard of Anna Popovna.</p>

<p>It was not for his advantage that his kindly foster-parents
never exacted from him any of the labours that fell to the lot
of the little mujiks, his playfellows. “Prepare to die, mujik,
but till the soil,” says the Russian proverb; and certainly where
there is no other education an early apprenticeship to manual
toil is rather a blessing than otherwise. Ivan’s idle hands and
restless feet were left quite at liberty to obey all the suggestions
of his active, untaught mind; while his naturally brave disposition
was rendered still more fearless from the fact of his never
having been, upon any occasion, punished or even thwarted or
reproved.</p>

<p>One summer morning, just as the first faint streaks of dawn
began to brighten the cottage window, he rose softly from his
sleeping-place on the shelf above the stove. All the rest had
worked hard the day before, and were slumbering soundly now;
so he dressed himself quietly, and going to the great carved
chest lifted the heavy lid with difficulty and took out and put
on his rough sheep-skin coat, or shuba; then he drew on his
warm boots of Russia leather lined with fur; next, he cut for
himself with a hatchet a great piece of sour black bread, and
tied it in a cloth as provision for the way; lastly, he went to a
secret hiding-place of his own and transferred to his pocket his
greatest treasure&mdash;a silver rouble mativshka had given him.
Having done all this, he was hurrying forth with quick noiseless
footsteps, when he remembered an omitted duty. Returning a
step or two, he took his stand before the picture in the corner,
made a reverence, and repeated a hasty prayer; then, with a
brave heart and a quiet conscience, he went forth in search of
what fate might bring him,&mdash;a little knight-errant going to look
for adventures.</p>

<p>He passed through the sleeping village, with the familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
brown cottages on either side of him looking peaceful and homelike
in the morning twilight. The church-bell in the tall elm-tree
seemed to beckon him near; he could scarcely resist the
temptation of climbing the tree, seizing the rope, and astonishing
the village with an untimely peal. Only the reflection that
this would inevitably bring his own adventure to an abrupt
conclusion stayed his hand. Leaving the houses behind him,
he passed through fields rich with waving corn, then through
pasture-lands, from which he emerged at length upon a bare,
monotonous, sandy plain. Now, for the first time, he ventured
to beguile his way with a song; and his clear, ringing, childish
voice sounded far and wide, yet failed to reach any human ear.
Nor would it have fared otherwise with a cry for help, however
shrill and agonized.</p>

<p>Ivan, happily, did not think of this. Fleet of foot and light
of heart, he pursued his course, still singing as he went, until
village, corn-fields, and birch-woods were all left far behind him.
And now, wherever he looked, he saw nothing but a dreary
waste of sand, with here and there a few patches of stunted
herbage, and at rare intervals a solitary pine or a little cluster
of birch-trees. The stillness was absolute: the children of the
air eschewed that land of barrenness, and the beasts of the field
seemed also to have abandoned it. None of the gentler races
that man has succeeded in taming found pasture there; and
fortunately wolves were extremely rare, though not quite unknown.
Ivan never dreamed of them; his one concern was to
keep the road, for so he called the track made by the wheels of
the rude waggons which brought the produce of the corn-fields
to the river Oka. He knew that a ferry-boat crossed the river,
bringing adventurous travellers to the great Moscow road on
the other side. This road was the goal of his ambition. As
already intimated, no clear distinction existed in his mind between
the Moscow road and Moscow itself, the holy city towards
which the heart of every Russian yearned with reverent love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
and passionate longing. It was their Jerusalem, “beautiful for
situation, the joy of the whole earth.” Even ignorant little
Ivan had heard of its wonders and its glories; and he fancied
that if once he gained the road he might see in the distance
the gilded spires and domes of the Kremlin gleaming in the
sun. Michael had never seen so much as that, nor been so far
from home!</p>

<p>The sun, in Russia such a rare and much-prized guest, was
prodigal of his favours that day, and shone forth from a cloudless
sky. Ivan had equipped himself for a winter journey, and
about noon he began to grow hot and weary. No shelter was
near him, so he sat down on the sand, rested a little, and ate
some of his bread; but he longed in vain for a draught of
kvass<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> to finish his repast, nor could he find a single drop of
water anywhere. He rose unrefreshed and pursued his way;
but, in spite of all his childish courage, the utter loneliness
of the dreary waste around him began to tell upon his spirits.
He sang, he shouted, he talked aloud to himself, merely for
the comfort of hearing his own voice; until by-and-by he became
too weary for these exercises&mdash;all he could contrive to
do was to keep moving on with a kind of dogged determination.
Once and again was he tempted to turn back and give
up the adventure; indeed, he would have done so, only for the
thought, “If I come back having seen nothing, Michael will jeer
me, and Anna Popovna will join in the laugh.”</p>

<p>At last he grew so tired and frightened that he threw himself
on the ground in a kind of despair, made the sign of the cross,
said a prayer to his patron St. John the evangelist, then fell
into a state of drowsiness, and lost all sense of time, until,
after an interval of perhaps an hour, he was aroused by the
sound of voices.</p>

<p>Never had human voices seemed more welcome. Ivan
started to his feet, and saw to his great delight a party of five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
or six mujiks, carrying large baskets of cabbages and other
vegetables. Greetings were soon exchanged. His new friends
told him that they were journeying from a distant village to a
fair at Kaluga, a town on the other bank of the Oka. They
intended, after crossing the river, to travel all night, that they
might reach the fair with their merchandise early the next
morning. They took the tired little wayfarer by the hand and
helped him on, encouraging him with kind words, and telling
him they were now not far from the ferry.</p>

<p>At last the river appeared in the distance, glimmering in the
light of the rising moon. “Look,” cried his companions,
“yonder is the Oka.” But Ivan was by this time too weary to
care; he could scarcely keep his eyes open and his feet moving.</p>

<p>They drew nearer and nearer. The river was as broad as the
Thames&mdash;a fine sheet of water, with green banks on either side.
From these there came a hoarse, monotonous sound&mdash;the croaking
of innumerable frogs, which some one has unpoetically
called “the nightingales of Russia.” Soon a brown wooden
shed came into view, where the men said they would find kvass,
and perhaps even vodka.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> This roused Ivan, who was still
tormented with thirst. He saw the moonlight upon the waters;
the grassy sward beside them; the rough boat-house, out of
which a withered old woman, with a red handkerchief wrapped
around her head and a torch of pine-wood in her hand, came to
meet the wayfarers.</p>

<p>There was no boat to be had, she said; her son had not
returned, though she expected him before sundown;&mdash;she could
not think what detained him. The peasants were grievously
disappointed. The sale of their merchandise depended on their
reaching the fair in good time, so their vexation was quite
natural. It was somewhat allayed, however, by the offer of
vodka, that charmer so fatally dear to the heart of the mujik.
And their weary little companion was not quite forgotten.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
“Give the little one a taste, mother,” they said. “Poor child,
he is ready to faint.”</p>

<p>It was to the honour of the people of Nicolofsky that, though
themselves no patterns of sobriety, they had at least kept the
destroyer from the young lips of their nursling. Ivan turned
from the fiery beverage with loathing, and asked for kvass.
“Here is no kvass,” said the old woman roughly. “No man
would be fool enough to drink it who could get vodka. But
you can have water, if you like.”</p>

<p>With this he was content. He wrapped himself up in his
shuba, lay down beside the fire in the shed, and was soon fast
asleep; while the mujiks sat outside talking, laughing, singing,
and drinking vodka.</p>

<span class="smcap1 w">When</span> Ivan awoke it was broad daylight; the shed
was empty, and all around him still and silent.
After a few moments of bewilderment, he remembered
where he was, and a sudden terror seized
him lest the boat might have come and gone, and his companions
have crossed the river without him. So he threw on his shuba
and hurried out. They were standing on the bank, watching
eagerly for the boat&mdash;or rather for the boatman, of whom
as yet there was no appearance, though they were tantalized by
the sight of the empty boat lying high and dry on the opposite
bank. Their irritation increased every moment, and curses
were not wanting, which lost none of their effect uttered in that
hard, resonant, metallic language.</p>

<p>At this point a new wayfarer joined the group. He came
with long strides, as one in eager haste, and his annoyance at
the delay seemed even greater than that of the rest. He was
a fine, active, young fellow, neatly dressed, and with a mason’s
trowel stuck in the sash of his caftan, where all the others
carried the indispensable axe. Seeing no sign of the approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
of a boat, he grew pale, and ground his teeth with angry disappointment.</p>

<p>“Just like my luck!” he muttered. “As well throw myself
into the river at once, as wait here much longer.”</p>

<p>“Patience, friend,” said the oldest of the mujiks. “Are we
not all in the like case? Nay, we are worse off than you, for
we have waited here all night.”</p>

<p>“Worse off! you little know! With you it is a matter
of a few kopecks; with me it is life and death. If I am
not at Klopti by sundown, there is the knout for my
back.”</p>

<p>“Why? In Heaven’s name, what have you done?”</p>

<p>“Done! nothing in the world but work at my trade, and
pay my obrok truly to my lord” (for he was one of that numerous
class of serfs who were permitted by their lords to work on
their own account, upon payment of an annual tax, or <i xml:lang="ru" lang="ru">obrok</i>).
“But he raised my obrok three times, until at last I could
scarcely live, and was left no chance of saving a rouble or two
for the future. Then last summer I fell from the scaffolding of
a house I was building, and was sore hurt. Only that the
people I lodged with were good Christians, it would have gone
ill with me. But I recovered, thanks to my patron St. Stefen;
and when the spring came on I got work again&mdash;government
work too, which is well paid. I made up my obrok, and then&mdash;why
then, my brothers, the world went well with me, and
my heart was light. Little Katinka, the daughter of the kind
soul that took care of me while I was ill, was the prettiest girl
in the quarter, and good and pure like a candle of white wax
made to burn before the picture of a holy saint. So we gave
each other our troth; and I think the Czar himself on his golden
throne was scarce happier than I. But five days ago there came
a messenger from Klopti to call me home at once. My lord
wants to make him a new house, and must needs have me to
build it for him and to teach the men of the village to build<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
also. It was sudden; but my lord does not think much of us
poor people&mdash;God forgive him!”</p>

<p>“But, brother;&mdash;what is it you call yourself?” asked the
mujik who had spoken before.</p>

<p>“Stefen Alexitch, at your service.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, Brother Stefen, why did you not set out at
once? You would have been by this time at your journey’s
end.”</p>

<p>“I know it. Indeed I was wrong, very wrong. But the
very next day was Katinka’s feast-day, and as I knew only
too well that I was never likely to look on her sweet face again,
I was tempted to stay, just that I might dance one more measure
with her. I thought I could have walked more quickly. And
now this cursed delay! God grant my lord may not lose patience
altogether, and wreak his vengeance on my poor old father
and mother! That would be worse than the knout across my
own shoulders.”</p>

<p>Stefen’s narrative elicited many expressions of compassion.</p>

<p>“Poor lad! thy case is hard indeed,” said one.</p>

<p>“Ah,” sighed another, “how true the proverb, ‘Heaven is
high, and the Czar far off.’”</p>

<p>But at that moment a third exclaimed <span class="locked">joyfully,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Look, brothers!&mdash;the boat at last!”</p>

<p>So it was. At first it was seen to shoot rapidly across the
strong current of the river; but by-and-by the rower seemed to
flag, and his strokes grew uncertain and unsteady.</p>

<p>The mujiks were too glad to see him on any terms to be
critical about the quality of his performances. They crowded
to the river’s brink, that they might be ready to spring into the
boat the moment it touched the land.</p>

<p>Ivan took advantage of the confusion to steal up to Stefen
and slip his silver rouble quietly into his hand. “Take it,” he
whispered. “It is all I have; but you can get a fairing with
it to send to Katinka.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
It was poor consolation; but he meant it well, and Stefen’s
sore heart was soothed by the gentle touch. He bent over the
boy and kissed him. There was no time to do more; if they
wished to get places in the boat, they must hasten.</p>

<p>The boatman, meanwhile, was volubly explaining the cause
of his delay, his speech thickened with much vodka. A party
of boyars&mdash;<em>very</em> great boyars, high and mighty excellencies&mdash;had
come to the post-house on the Moscow road, and the postmaster
had kept him busy going on their errands, both last
night and this morning. It was easy to see in what coin his
services had been paid for; he had taken so much vodka that
he was scarcely able to row the boat at all, and, moreover, it
was too heavily freighted for safety, not to say for comfort.</p>

<p>Ivan had never been on the water before, and he soon became
thoroughly frightened; not without reason. When they reached
the middle of the river the boatman showed himself so manifestly
incapable that Stefen offered to take the oars. Russian peasants
are usually good-tempered, even when under the influence of
vodka; but the boatman, unhappily, was surly and dogged by
nature, and rudely refused to yield his place. For a few minutes
Stefen waited quietly; then seeing that the man was allowing
the boat to drift, to the peril of all their lives, he made
an attempt to take the oars from him by force. The boatman
resisted, and a struggle ensued, from which Ivan hid his face in
terror; for now the two men were standing up, striking and pushing
each other wildly, while the frail, heavily-laden boat swayed
and rocked beneath their reckless feet. One was drunk, the
other angry and “bitter of soul.” At length Ivan heard a
heavy plash close beside him. Hastily uncovering his eyes, he
saw the waters closing over the luckless Stefen, and uttered a
cry of horror. To his great relief, however, Stefen rose again
to the surface, and one of the mujiks, seizing an oar, held it out
to him. But either he had lost his presence of mind, or, more
probably, his head had been hurt by the boat in falling. At all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
events, he made no effort to grasp the oar; and the mujiks&mdash;ignorant,
stupid, and awkward, though not lacking in kindliness&mdash;gave
him up for lost. Indeed, their own situation was critical
enough; but they got to the shore somehow.</p>

<p>The boatman was sobered by the shock, and almost stupified
with grief for what had happened. But the others crowded
round him, and urged him to go and seek for poor Stefen’s
body, that he might at least be buried like a Christian. This
he consented to do; and the task of finding it proved unexpectedly
easy, for a miniature island, in the midst of the
river, with a single tree growing upon it, had arrested the
body as it was borne downwards by the strong current of the
stream. The group on the shore waited in mournful silence
while the boatman and two of the mujiks went and returned,
bringing with them their solemn freight, which they laid sadly
and reverently on the fair greensward, beneath the happy
morning sun.</p>

<p>All crossed themselves and murmured a prayer for his soul;
and the oldest of the mujiks detached a little sacred picture
from his own neck and laid it on his breast.</p>

<p>It was Ivan’s first meeting face to face with the king of terrors.
The form so lately full of life and energy lay stiff and
rigid; while the brow, the cheek, the lips&mdash;when he saw the
strange and solemn change that had swept over all these, his
young heart could bear no more, he lifted up his voice and wept.
His tears unlocked the floodgates of the general sorrow; all the
mujiks standing around him wept and wrung their hands, like
the grown-up children that in truth they were.</p>

<p>Just at that moment, as if to throw into strongest relief the
contrast between life and death, between earth’s brightest sunshine
and her deepest shadows, a young boyar from the party
at the post-house came riding rapidly over the smooth greensward.
Drawing near the weeping group, he checked his horse
to a foot-pace, and Ivan turned and looked at him. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
no splendour in his dress&mdash;an officer’s uniform, gray in colour
and plain in fashion. But his face, which seemed to bring the
glow and glory of the morning with it, held Ivan’s gaze with a
kind of fascination. Features almost perfect enough for the
deathless marble of a Grecian sculptor might have worn no
charm to his untrained eye, if they had not also beamed with
a kindness and gentleness that took his heart at once. That
bright, young face&mdash;the first beardless manly face he remembered
to have seen&mdash;left itself for ever on his mind. It was
destined to be the inspiration of his life; and when death
closed his eyes, he had scarcely a dearer hope than to see it
once again in the morning of the resurrection.</p>

<p>The boyar, meanwhile, had come quite close to the group ere
he appeared to perceive distinctly the cause of their distress.
But no sooner had he done so than he sprang from his horse,
flinging the bridle to Ivan, who proudly accepted the charge.
The next moment he was bending over the lifeless form; the
next, he turned and said cheerfully to the mujiks standing
<span class="locked">near,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“My children, this is not death. We will save him yet.”</p>

<p>They were speechless with amazement. Was this stranger a
holy saint, a worker of miracles? They knew at least that he
was a nobleman and an officer, whom fortunately every
instinct of their nature, every habit of their lives, taught
them to obey without a question. Rapidly singling out two or
three of the most intelligent-looking, he set them to work&mdash;working
with them himself as Ivan, used to the dawdling,
dreamy ways of the mujiks, had never in his life seen any one
work before. By magic, as it seemed, poor Stefen’s dripping
clothes were removed, and he was wrapped in the warmest
garments the mujiks could contribute for the purpose&mdash;Ivan,
amongst others, gladly offering his little sheepskin shuba.
Then the cold and rigid limbs were gently chafed, a work of
time and patience. Those who were helping did mechanically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
whatever they were directed to do, while the rest looked on in
a kind of wondering stupefaction. How could even a boyar
expect to bring a dead man to life?</p>

<p>After a considerable time had been spent in this manner, the
whole party from the post-house came up, boyars and servants,
all on horseback. Instead of calling upon their companion to
join them, as Ivan rather expected them to do, the boyars at
once dismounted and joined <em>him</em>, leaving their horses on the
road in the care of the servants. One of these drew near Ivan,
and attempted to take his charge from him; but he resisted.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “My boyar’s hand gave this bridle into
mine, and into no other but his will I give it back again.”</p>

<p>“Let the boy alone, Ilya,” cried another of the attendants,
with a good-humoured laugh. “Let him keep his luck. It
may not come twice in his life-time.”</p>

<p>After that Ivan could not so easily see what was happening,
though he watched intently and with the keenest interest.
“His boyar” seemed to refer the matter, as to a person of
superior authority, to a very tall, very stern-looking individual,
who examined Stefen carefully, putting his hand on his heart
and on his wrist. Presently, and rather to Ivan’s horror, he
drew from his pocket a sort of case, out of which there flashed
a bright instrument of steel, like a thin sharp knife, and with
this he proceeded to inflict a deep cut upon Stefen’s arm; while,
far from objecting, the young boyar carefully held it for him,
and then produced a fine white kerchief of his own, which he
gave him to bind the wound.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>But still the pale, cold form lay there stiff and motionless.
Was it death? or was it only a death-like swoon? It was the
nobles who were busy now, chafing the cold hands and feet, and
using every other possible means to restore animation; for the
peasants had given place to them, and stood aside, silent and
wondering spectators of the scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Time passed: life and death were struggling for the mastery,
and the conflict was tedious and protracted. It was no even
contest. From the first, victory seemed to incline to the side of
the sable king. The chance of life, always desperate, lessened
apparently with every minute, and when the minutes grew to
hours it seemed to vanish altogether away. At last the tall surgeon
shook his head, and turning to the boyar said something in
a foreign tongue that evidently expressed despair. But <em>he</em> would
not admit the thought. Ivan knew not, of course, what he said
in answer, but it was easy to see that he had steadfastly resolved
not to abandon hope, and that he was entreating, urging,
even commanding the rest to continue their efforts.</p>

<p>Apparently for no purpose but to please him they obeyed.
An interval followed of renewed exertion, though of ever-waning
hope. At length, however, the surgeon’s instrument flashed
out once more, and almost immediately afterwards a thrill of
emotion passed through the entire group. One shuddering sigh,
one faint, low groan was heard from the lips that had seemed
to be sealed for ever in death. “Thank God!” said the boyar,
raising the military cap from his stately head with its clustering
chestnut curls. “This is amongst the brightest days
of my life.” Ivan stood near enough to see that his blue eyes
were full of tears.</p>

<p>Whilst they gave Stefen a little vodka, and prepared a kind
of litter in which to carry him to the post-house, several other
persons came up, including the priest and the starost of the
nearest village; for some of the mujiks had gone away and
spread the story of the strange things they had been witnessing.</p>

<p>Then to Ivan’s young eyes the scene became confused. Much
happened that he could not exactly understand. But Stefen
was alive&mdash;that at least was certain, for he saw him try to kiss
the hand that had so patiently drawn him back from the gates
of the grave. And now, for the first time, the thought occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
to Ivan that his triumph over Michael would be complete and
glorious. Michael assuredly had never seen a dead man brought
to life again!</p>

<p>At last the great people seemed to be preparing to pursue
their journey. Ivan watched “his boyar” as he talked for
some time to the priest and the starost, who stood before him
with uncovered heads and an air of the deepest reverence;
then, seeing him look for his horse, he led his charge forward,
and held the stirrup gracefully while he mounted. He got a
word of praise for his “long patience,” and a bright piece of
gold glittered in his hand.</p>

<p>“Take me with you, my boyar,” he cried, with a sudden impulse.
“Let me serve you; I would <em>love</em> to do it.”</p>

<p>“My child, you shall serve me one day&mdash;not yet,” said the
boyar, smiling.</p>

<p>A few moments more, and the stately cavalcade had moved
away. Ivan stood in silence, unable to withdraw his gaze from
the retreating figure of his hero until it was lost in the distance.</p>

<p>The white-haired priest came up to him and laid his hand
on his shoulder. “My lad,” he said, “do you know who has
spoken to you&mdash;whose horse you have had the honour of
holding?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ivan, wakening out of a dream; “no&mdash;yes&mdash;at
least I know it was a boyar, a great, and good, and splendid
boyar, with the face of an angel. I love him!”</p>

<p>“Then pray for him all the days of thy life, for know that
he is none other than thy sovereign lord and mine, the Czar
Alexander Paulovitch.”</p>

<p>Ivan stared, then burst out laughing. “You are jesting with
me,” he said. “Nay, father, I am only a boy, but I know
better than that. I am quite twelve years old, and I know
very well that the Czar lives in St. Petersburg, and wears a
golden crown, and sits upon a throne, and all the boyars stand
uncovered around him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
“Still, I tell thee truth. That handsome young officer was
the great Czar himself&mdash;the lord of all the Russias. To prove
my words&mdash;I am a poor man, but I will give thee twice, three
times its value for that coin in thy hand, which his hand
touched.”</p>

<p>Ivan shook his head. “No, no, father; I don’t believe a
word of your story; but I love my boyar, and I will not give
away his gift. He said I should serve him one day, and I
mean to do it. Though, to be sure,” he added, thoughtfully,
“I might almost part with it for poor Stefen’s sake, and to do
a good deed. How will he dare to meet his master’s face&mdash;later
than ever now?”</p>

<p>“Never trouble thyself for thy friend Stefen; he is rich
enough this day to buy his freedom, if he will. He who gave
him back his life has taken care to make that life worth the
keeping.”</p>

<p>“Then he can marry Katinka?”</p>

<p>“He can marry whom he pleases. Our lord the Czar never
leaves anything half done.”</p>

<p>“Oh! what a good day it has been!” and Ivan, in his own
estimation far too old to be deceived by an idle story, was by
no means too old to leap and dance for very joy.</p>

<p>“You believe <em>that</em>,” said the priest; “then why do you doubt
the rest of my story?”</p>

<p>“Because,” returned Ivan, “I have wit enough to know that
the great Czar, who ‘is God upon earth,’ as the proverb says,
would not care for the life of a poor mujik, and toil hard to
save it, as my boyar did this day.”</p>

<p>“Well, fools will be fools while the world lasts. Here, take
thy shuba; Stefen left it for thee when they brought him to
the post-house. Go thy ways; and God teach thee that it
shows more wit to believe what one is told than to question it.”</p>

<p>“Good day, father,” returned Ivan; “I am going home&mdash;to
Nicolofsky, where people speak the truth to their neighbours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
With this parting shaft, he drew on his shuba, and turned
his steps homewards, highly pleased with his adventure. What
a story he would have for the starost and mativshka, for Pope
Nikita and one-eared Michael, not to speak of Anna Popovna,
by no means the least in his estimation!</p>

<p>He crossed the river without delay&mdash;the ferry-boat and the
penitent ferryman being this time both in readiness&mdash;and then
he resumed his journey on foot. As he walked, he ate the remainder
of his bread; for he had tasted nothing that day, and
it was now long past noon. With a happy heart he pursued
his way until about sunset, when fatigue obliged him to stop
and rest. He lay down under a solitary fir-tree, intending only
to indulge in a short&mdash;a <em>very</em> short slumber. But nature proved
too strong for him: when he awoke again the sky was flushed
with the light of early dawn. The remainder of his task was
quickly accomplished: he walked into the starost’s cottage as
the family were sitting down to their morning meal of kasha,
or stewed grain.</p>

<p>Warm was the welcome and great were the rejoicings that
greeted his appearance. The poor people had been sorely terrified
by the mysterious absence of their nursling, and they had
sought him far and near, through the birch-wood and the corn-fields,
and even for some distance in the waste. They were
preparing to renew the search that day with anxious and foreboding
hearts.</p>

<p>Almost all Nicolofsky crowded to the starost’s cottage to
congratulate Ivan and to hear his wonderful story. Certainly,
he had attained his object, if that object was to make himself
the hero of the village, and totally and for ever to eclipse the
exploits of Michael Ivanovitch!</p>

<p>But Ivan was no more the thoughtless little lad who set out
two days ago in search of adventures. His young heart had
awakened from the sleep of childhood; new feelings, vague and
dimly comprehended, were beginning to stir it. As he trod his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
homeward way, full of all the wonders he had witnessed, a
voice seemed to murmur within him, “And I, too, am a boyar.”
What did it mean to be a boyar? He had no words in which
to express his thought; but the dawning light of a grand truth,
faint and far off, shone upon him from the face of the first
boyar he had ever seen, as it bent anxiously and tenderly over
the mujik’s senseless form&mdash;that to be greater than all the rest
meant to do good to all the rest.</p>

<p>He told his adventures modestly and truthfully. What he
had done with his silver rouble he told no one, but he showed
the gold piece that had been given him with proud pleasure, and
asked the starost to make a hole in it, as he wished to keep it
always, and to wear it on the ribbon round his neck with the
little iron cross put there at his baptism.</p>

<p>He told what the priest had said to him, adding, however,
“But of course he was mocking me; no one could believe such
a foolish story as that.”</p>

<p>Every one present agreed with him, except Pope Nikita, who
pondered awhile, and then said thoughtfully, “Who knows? it
may have been. After all, One greater than the Czar put his
hands upon the poor sick folk and healed them.”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<span class="subhead">IVAN’S HORIZON WIDENS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="b2 center">“Behind the orphan, God himself bears a purse.”&mdash;<i>Russian Proverb.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap-image">
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_n.jpg" width="73" height="72" alt="" />
<span class="smcap1 n">No</span> child ever dreams of being grateful for food and
shelter, unless taught by the sad experience of
destitution. The little guest expects to be welcomed
to the feast of life, and even assumes that
the board has been spread on purpose for him. Ivan was no
exception to the rule: hitherto he had received the devotion
and tenderness of those around him as a matter of course;
perhaps indeed he was in danger of exacting them as a right,
and of becoming, as he grew older, proud and overbearing.
But now a change had come. If he knew that he was noble,
he had also gained a glimpse of the great truth that “Noblesse
oblige.” He had begun to reflect, and to some purpose.</p>

<p>“Bativshka,” he said one day to the starost, “why was it
you were afraid to let the lord Zoubof or the steward Dmitri
know who I was?”</p>

<p>“Because they might have killed you, Barrinka, out of spite
and jealousy, knowing that your father was our lord before
Zoubof came.”</p>

<p>“But would they have done anything to <em>you</em>, bativshka, for
taking care of me?”</p>

<p>“Oh! as to <em>that</em> I don’t know. Perhaps I might have had
the knout.”</p>

<p>Ivan bent down and kissed the old man’s hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
The next morning, when the family rose early to begin the
toils of the harvest, Ivan rose with them. “I am going to the
field,” he quietly observed, putting on his oldest garments.</p>

<p>All protested, especially mativshka, whose love for her foster-child
amounted to weakness.</p>

<p>“Dmitri and Vasil and little Peter are going, and they are
all younger than I am,” said Ivan.</p>

<p>“But <em>they</em> are only little mujiks,” she answered. “They
must work hard for their bit of rye bread and their bowl of
kasha. It was for that God made them.”</p>

<p>“Boyars work too;&mdash;I am a boyar,” said Ivan, raising his
fair head proudly; and he went with the rest.</p>

<p>To do him justice, he bore himself bravely in the field,
although the unaccustomed toil wearied him quickly, and it
was tantalizing to find himself so easily outdone by Michael’s
stronger limbs and more practised hands. Yet, after all, it was
no great hardship to bind the sheaves along with Anna Popovna
all the morning, and at noon to share with her his dinner of
okroshka.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>But harvest-time does not last for ever. At length all the
sheaves were gathered in: the wheat to be sold for the profit
of the lord of the soil; the rye to be transformed into the black
bread, the kvass, the kasha, which were the staple of the
mujik’s diet;&mdash;for, as they said themselves in one of their terse
though homely proverbs, “Wheat picks and chooses, but Mother
Rye feeds all fools alike.” Then the long blank winter settled
down over Nicolofsky, which, like the rest of Russia, “lay
numb beneath the snow” for many a month in the year.</p>

<p>During this silent, dreary season the industrious fingers of
the girls and women found occupation in spinning and weaving.
The lads too made lapti, wove rude baskets, and prepared firewood;
and these occupations were often pursued in social
gatherings, and lightened with jest and song and story. Still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
there was abundant leisure, in which the young people amused
themselves with games of babshky&mdash;little pieces of mutton
bone, which they used as English children use nine-pins&mdash;while
their elders sat beside the stoves, and too often enlivened their
gossip with much vodka. In this respect, however, Nicolofsky
contrasted rather favourably with other villages, since the
starost and the pope were both temperate men and set a good
example.</p>

<p>They were great friends, and during their long confidential
talks one question often came uppermost, What was to be
done with Ivan when he grew up? In a country like Russia,
where sons almost invariably followed the calling of their
fathers, and every man’s position was assigned him by the fact
of his birth, it was peculiarly difficult to find a niche for a
waif like Ivan. A mujik, of course, he could never be; nor a
priest, since he was not a popovitch, or priest’s son; nor a
merchant, that would have been a terrible degradation for one
who was born a boyar; nor a soldier, for his village friends had
not the influence necessary to procure him a commission, while
had he been drawn for a recruit they would at once have provided
a substitute. But Ivan was not old enough to share
these perplexities. The knowledge that he was by birth a
boyar, with the desire, sincere though ignorant and wavering,
to be worthy of his destiny, sufficed him for the present.</p>

<p>Thus two long winters passed away. A second spring had
come, heralded by the eight days of drinking and carousing
which the Russians call the Mässlanitza, or “Butter-week.”
Then the long fast went slowly by. At last came the crown of
the Russian year, with Easter eggs, and joyous greetings, and
manifold festivities.</p>

<p>One fine evening, a few weeks after, a kibitka, or rude one-horse
vehicle, drove up to the starost’s door. Its occupant, a
well-dressed man, whose hair and beard of iron gray showed
him past the prime of life, flung the rope that served him for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
rein on the horse’s neck, and entered the izba. He first made
his reverence to the sacred picture in the corner, then courteously
saluted the starost and his wife, who, without speaking,
placed some bread and salt on a carved wooden trencher and
offered them to him. He tasted both; and this indispensable
ceremony performed, he began at once to make known his
errand.</p>

<p>“God save you, Alexis Vasilovitch!” he said to the starost.
“Do you chance to remember in your early youth one Feodor
Petrovitch, who was born here?”</p>

<p>“Feodor Petrovitch?” repeated the starost, stroking his
beard meditatively.</p>

<p>“Feodor Petrovitch?” cried his wife. “Yes, I think <em>I</em>
remember him. Had he coal-black hair, and eyes like an
eagle’s?”</p>

<p>“That he had; but the hair is now snow-white, and the
eagle eyes&mdash;well, no marvel, they served him fourscore years.&mdash;I
am his eldest son, Ivan Petrovitch.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I too remember him now!” said the starost, “though,
like my wife, I was but a child when he went away. Many a
time our old folk have told us how our good lord, Prince
Pojarsky, the last but one, took such notice of him on account
of his bright face and clever ways&mdash;how he had him taught to
read and write and to count up money. At last he took him
away somewhere, so that after he came to man’s estate Nicolofsky
knew him no more.”</p>

<p>“All quite true. The prince sent him to Moscow, and when
his education was finished he gave him a sum of money to trade
with. My father quickly doubled it; and, unlike most men,
he brought every kopeck honestly to his lord. ‘Go on and
prosper,’ said the prince. ‘Take that money with thee and
double it again.’ He did so. Then said the prince, ‘Feodor
Petrovitch, thou hast paid me thy last obrok. From this day
thou art free.’ He divided the money into two parts, declaring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
himself well satisfied with half, and leaving the other half to
my father to start with on his own account. Large hearts had
the Princes of Pojarsky, one and all, God rest their souls!
From that day all things prospered with my father; and now
he and his have silver and gold more than enough for their
needs. For he has sons and sons’ sons, all prosperous&mdash;one
here and one there, as God wills. About fifteen days ago,
tidings reached him, through Dmitri, Zoubof’s steward, which
filled his aged heart with joy. The grandson of our lord is living
still, and among you. I am come the bearer of my father’s
earnest prayer that you would give the boy to him. It will be
his pride and pleasure to have him taught all that a young
noble ought to know, and so to maintain and provide for him
that he may go without shame among his equals, and live the
kind of life that is right for such as he. And I, the son of
Petrovitch, say that therein my father will do well. Since
every rouble and kopeck we have came from Prince Pojarsky,
it is right that some should go back to his heir. But my
father prays of you to send him the little lad at once, while
yet he can see his face, for God’s hand is fast drawing down
a curtain over his aged eyes. What say you, Starost Alexis
Vasilovitch?”</p>

<p>The starost paused. At length he said firmly, though in a
broken voice&mdash;“That we love our little lord too well not to
send him with you&mdash;ay, and that thankfully, though it wrings
our hearts to part with him. Ah! here he comes himself.&mdash;Ivan
Barrinka, this good man will take you with him to
Moscow the holy, and make of you that which it is your birthright
to be.”</p>

<p>Petrovitch gazed admiringly on the tall, graceful figure of
the handsome lad, now about fourteen, and looking considerably
older. “Praise be to God!” he said. “That is a goodly shoot
from the old stem.”</p>

<p>Ivan’s face changed rapidly from pale to red, and from red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
again to pale. At last he said, “Bativshka, I will do what <em>you</em>
think I ought.”</p>

<p>“Then, dear child, you will go from us; for like should ever
dwell with like.”</p>

<p>But the old foster-mother lifted up her voice in lamentation,
mingling her tears for her “little dove,” her nursling, her
treasure, with regrets that his shirts were not in order, that the
new socks they had been knitting for him in the winter were
not finished, and that his boots wanted mending.</p>

<p>“We will see to all that in the city, good mother,” said
Petrovitch, unable to repress a smile, as he pictured the extraordinary
transformation Ivan’s outer man would have to undergo
before he could take his pleasure in the Kremlin gardens with
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élite</i> of Moscow society.</p>

<p>Hospitality is a plant that flourishes luxuriantly in Russian
soil, and seems to find the smoky atmosphere of the izba as
congenial as the clearer air of the palace. It was with great
difficulty that Petrovitch could fix his departure for the next
day but one; but a single day of rest for himself and of preparation
for Ivan was all that the starost’s importunities could
obtain from him, since he knew his father’s anxiety about the
result of his mission.</p>

<p>That evening, in the starost’s cottage, there was much baking
of wheaten bread, of cakes called kissel, and of greasy, indigestible
pastry called pirogua. There was also a great slaughter,&mdash;a
sheep, a couple of sucking pigs, and quite a multitude of
fowls were sacrificed on the altar of hospitality; for the whole
of Nicolofsky would no doubt <em>assist</em> at the festival of the next
day, not in the French, but in the English sense of the word.
Huge buckets of kvass were of course prepared; and it might
have been better if this harmless beverage had not been supplemented
by a plentiful supply of vodka.</p>

<p>Next day began, not unworthily, with a service in the church,
a kind of farewell to Ivan and compliment to Petrovitch. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
its remaining hours were wholly given up to revelry, and it is
to be feared that but few sober men went to rest that night in
Nicolofsky. Meanwhile Ivan bade farewell to the friends and
playfellows of his childhood. With Anna Popovna his parting
was a tearful one. He kissed her again and again, and vowed
that he would come back and marry her as soon as his beard
was grown.</p>

<p>“God be praised!” said her mother, who was standing by.
“See how St. Nicholas protects the innocent, and will not let
him take the sin of a false vow upon his soul! He does not
dream, poor child, that his beard will never grow at all, since
he is born a boyar, who will have to shave it off every morning&mdash;worse
luck for him.”</p>

<p>But the saddest and most tender farewells were spoken at
daybreak on the following morning, when Ivan was kissed and
wept over by his foster-parents, and by all their immediate
family. His own eyes were dim as he took his place in the
kibitka beside Petrovitch; and when he turned to look his
last upon the brown cottages of Nicolofsky, he could scarcely
see them through his tears.</p>

<p>“But the winds of the morn blew away the tear.” By-and-by
Ivan cheered up a little. He roused himself to listen to his
companion’s stories of the great city, and began to be interested,
and even to ask questions.</p>

<p>There was not much in the incidents of their journey to
engage or rivet his attention. They crossed the Oka upon a raft&mdash;horse,
kibitka, and all&mdash;but not at the spot so well remembered
by Ivan as the scene of his adventure. After that came the
long monotonous Moscow road, where everything seemed to Ivan
always the same. Only that his senses assured him he was
moving, and that rapidly, he would have fancied himself fixed
in the centre of the same horizon, which was revolving around
him eternally and unchangingly. Plains of sand, forests of
birch or pine, went by in endless succession, merely diversified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
here and there by some pasture lands, or by a brown village
built upon the pattern of Nicolofsky. On one occasion, however,
they passed a company of horsemen carrying long lances,
and clad in gray cloaks, with ample hoods drawn over their
heads.</p>

<p>“Who are these?” Ivan asked with interest.</p>

<p>“Cossacks. I suppose they are going to join the army.
They had better have stayed at home now that peace is being
made with the French. That unlucky peace!” he grumbled,
touching his horse rather unnecessarily with his long whip.</p>

<p>“Why do you say that? I thought peace was always a good
thing. We have a proverb in Nicolofsky, ‘A bad peace is
better than a good quarrel.’”</p>

<p>“A bad peace with your enemies sometimes means a worse
quarrel with your best friends.&mdash;On, my little pope! Now,
now, my beauty, my darling, mind what you are about. Gee
up, you barbarian!” This to his horse, the wheel of the
kibitka having stuck fast in a deep rut. A touch of the whip,
this time in earnest, and the horse bounded on, freeing the
wheel with a jolt that brought Ivan to his feet, and shook peace
and war alike out of his thoughts. But Petrovitch, more
accustomed to the ordinary incidents of travel, presently resumed
the thread of his discourse.</p>

<p>“What does peace with France mean? War with England,
for one thing. And that&mdash;what does that mean? Our ports
shut up, our trade destroyed. No market for our timber,
our corn, our tallow, our furs. Ruin, ruin!” groaned the
merchant.</p>

<p>“I have heard of France,” said Ivan. “But England&mdash;what
is that?”</p>

<p>“England is a great, rich, beautiful country, with the sea like
a wall of defence built by the hand of God all around it. The
King of England hates Napoleon, and has sworn before the
picture of his saint never to make peace with him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
“I have heard of Napoleon too,” said Ivan. “The recruits
who left our village said they were going to fight against him.
Pope Nikita thinks he is a magician.”</p>

<p>“Pope Nikita thinks truly. It is said he has for his wife a
beautiful lady named Josephine, who transforms herself at will
into the likeness of a white dove, flies into the midst of his
enemies, hears all they say, and comes back and tells her lord.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
No one can resist him; the Emperor of Austria and the King
of Prussia are both at his feet, and he has conquered all the
other kings and dukes of the Nyemtzi, except the King of
England.”</p>

<p>“But the Czar&mdash;why does not the Czar send his soldiers and
tell them to kill him?” queried Ivan.</p>

<p>“Not so easy!” Petrovitch answered with a short laugh.
“However, there is little to be said after all. Russia has
fought him long and well. If the devil helps his own, what
can good orthodox Christians do? Think of Austerlitz, Eylau,
Friedland&mdash;blood and tears have flowed in torrents. I know
a widow who lost her two sons at Austerlitz. Another;&mdash;but
why speak of these things? War is always terrible.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you wish for peace?”</p>

<p>“A <em>good</em> peace might be very desirable, but save us from
a peace that will ruin our commerce!” cried Petrovitch with
energy. “The Czar has evil counsellors around him who are
persuading him to that sort of peace. Perhaps, indeed,
Napoleon has bewitched him with his sorceries. Who
knows?”</p>

<p>Having thus uttered, not merely his own sentiments, but
those of Moscow and her merchants upon the subject of the
Treaty of Tilsit, at that time in progress, Petrovitch relapsed
into silence. The only part of his discourse that greatly impressed
Ivan happened also to be the only part of it which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
not at least a considerable substratum of truth&mdash;the story of
the beautiful lady who could transform herself into a white
dove. The rest he understood very partially.</p>

<p>After a journey of many days, a happy change came over
the spirit of what had almost seemed to Ivan a long and
dismal dream. The dreary expanse of sandy waste was succeeded
by a green, fertile, well-cultivated plain, diversified by
the gentle slope of wooded hills and the gleam of a winding
river.</p>

<p>At last, one evening, they reached the summit of a lofty
eminence. Petrovitch, who was on foot leading the horse,
turned suddenly to Ivan, and said in a tone of solemnity,
“Take off thy cap, Ivan Barrinka, take off thy cap, and thank
God for thy first sight of holy Moscow!”</p>

<p>Any traveller might have thanked God for the beauty of that
sight. Dome and cupola, minaret and tower, shone beneath
them in the evening sunshine, giving back its rays with dazzling
brightness from their gilded tops; and some there were which
flamed like balls of fire suspended in the air. The brightest
and most varied of colours&mdash;green, purple, crimson, blue&mdash;relieved
and diversified the gleaming gold of the cupolas and
the burnished lead of the roofs, which looked like silver. Beyond
the bewildering glories of the Kremlin, whose feet were
kissed by the bright waters of the winding Moskva, the great
city stretched away into the distance. To the eye there was
no limit: streets and squares and gardens, gardens and streets
and squares; here a castle, there a blooming terrace; yonder a
painted gateway, everywhere light and colour, and shining
metallic surfaces that reflected the sun. “Forty times forty
churches” pointed upwards with their “silent fingers,” as if to
remind the dwellers in that city of palaces of the yet fairer city
which is eternal in the heavens, even the new Jerusalem, with
its streets of gold and gates of pearl.</p>

<p>Ivan crossed himself. “Beautiful! beautiful!” he murmured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
as he gazed like one entranced on the scene before
him.</p>

<p>“Upon God’s earth there is no spot like that,” said Petrovitch,
stretching forth his hand and pointing to the city. “‘If
I forget thee, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.’
God keep Moscow the holy, Moscow the beautiful, the ancient
city of the Czar, the fairest jewel of his crown, the apple of
his eye!”</p>

<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_o.jpg" width="73" height="72" alt="" />
<span class="smcap1 o">Our</span> travellers had still a long drive before them after
they entered the stately gate called “the Gate of
Triumph.” The ancient capital of the Czars enclosed,
within the vast circumference of its painted walls,
gardens, orchards, terraces, even parks and pleasure-grounds, in
this as in other ways resembling an Eastern city. In due time,
however, the merchants’ quarter was reached, and Ivan Petrovitch
drew rein before the gateway of a long, low, wooden building,
or rather range of buildings, painted in various colours. He
was evidently expected and watched for; quite a crowd of men,
women, and children, servants or members of the family, hurried
out to meet him, and his young companion shared the welcome
and the greetings that followed. Ivan Petrovitch, however, took
him by the hand, saying to those who were pressing around
them, “Stand back, brothers and sisters; no one should speak
to the little lord until he has been presented to our father.”</p>

<p>He led Ivan into a spacious room or hall, of which the
furniture, though far from answering to Western ideas of
comfort, showed conclusively that wealth was not lacking, for
vessels of silver, rugs of costly fur, and rich Turkish carpets
were there in abundance. But Ivan scarcely noticed anything,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
except the great arm-chair at the upper end and the venerable
figure of its occupant. “My father,” said the younger Petrovitch,
as he gently placed the boy directly in front of him, “I
have brought thee our little lord.”</p>

<p>The old man rose slowly from his chair, leaning upon his
staff. His hair was white as snow, and so was the beard which
reached nearly down to his waist. His large, dark eyes, once
so full of fire, were dim with age, but an ardent soul glanced
forth from them even yet, and they had, moreover, a wistful,
pathetic look, as if seeking the light which was fading from
them. “God be gracious to thee, Prince Ivan Ivanovitch
Pojarsky,” he said solemnly, laying his hand on the young fair
head which was bowed before him in instinctive reverence.
Then he kissed the boy, and having seated himself once more in
his chair, drew him close and examined his features. “Like
his grandfather, my dear friend and master,” he said at last.</p>

<p>It was evident, from the silence which followed, that thoughts
of other days came crowding fast upon the old man’s memory.
But he soon aroused himself from his reverie to bid Ivan welcome
to Moscow, and to commend him to the care of the
members of his family who had gathered around them.</p>

<p>These now came forward, drew Ivan gently away, and
lavished upon him every kindness and attention that could be
devised. He was charmed with his new friends, and quickly
and easily took his place as the honoured guest of the great
heterogeneous household united beneath the roof of its venerable
head. There were sons and sons’ sons, daughters-in-law
and grand-daughters, and quite a tribe of servants, forming
altogether a little clan rather than a family. This large household
had all the necessaries of life in abundance, and many
of its luxuries, though only such as the old Muscovite manners
and traditions fully sanctioned. For Petrovitch was an autocrat
in his own house, though usually a just and generous one.
Woe to the son or grandson of his who should presume to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
“deface the image of God” by shaving his beard, to exchange
his caftan for a French paletôt, or to lose his roubles and peril
his soul at the fashionable game of loto! This strong personal
government was the secret of the domestic peace which, on
the whole, prevailed in the household, notwithstanding the
many different elements of which it was composed.</p>

<p>There was only one person who ventured to take liberties
with the patriarch&mdash;to tease him, coax him, sometimes even
jest with him, always to claim his caresses as a matter of right,
not, like the others, as a rare, occasional favour. This was
little Feodor, a bright, black-eyed boy about three years
younger than Ivan. The mother of this favourite grandson
had been the only daughter of Petrovitch, and she was dead.
Much of the old man’s heart was in the grave with her, nor
could his seven brave and prosperous sons wholly supply her
place.</p>

<p>Ivan’s first days in Moscow were spent in viewing its wonders,
under the guidance of one or other of the Petrovitch family.
Feodor was often with him, and soon became his particular
friend; for his playfellows at Nicolofsky having been dull and
slow, the overflowing merriment of his new acquaintance was
a welcome change. He was shown the marvels of the Kremlin,&mdash;its
palace, its three cathedrals, its bell-tower of Ivan
Veliki, to the top of which he ascended and beheld the panorama
of the city stretched out beneath him like a picture. He saw
also the great Cathedral of St. Basil, in the “Beautiful” Place
outside the Kremlin wall. He saw the Chinese city and the
dwellings of the Tartars; he wandered through the streets and
rows of the Grand Bazaar. In fact, he saw so many wonderful
things that his power of wondering was exhausted, and he soon
ceased to be much impressed by any of them.</p>

<p>Each time that he returned from one of these expeditions,
old Petrovitch would call him to his side, and make him sit
where he could see his face. One evening he said to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
“God make thee as brave and true as thine ancestor, the great
Prince Pojarsky, who delivered Moscow from the Poles.”</p>

<p>“Who was he? I have never heard of him,” said Ivan.</p>

<p>“Is that possible? Poor child! did no one ever tell thee
that story, so glorious for thee and thine? Know, then, that
about two hundred years ago the Poles conquered holy Russia.
The whole country was at their feet, in great misery and trouble,
and no man dared resist them. Prince Pojarsky lay on his bed
in his own castle, sick as it seemed unto death. But God put
it into the heart of a poor man working at his trade in Moscow,
a butcher named Minim, to save his country. He first went to all
the great people of the city and of the surrounding country, and
got them to promise men and money. Then he went to Prince
Pojarsky, and stood before him like a messenger from God.
‘Rise,’ he said; ‘go forth and conquer the Poles. God will
strengthen thee.’ ‘But soldiers are needed, and arms,’ said the
prince. ‘All are ready,’ answered the courageous citizen. The
prince arose from his bed of sickness, and, trusting in God, put
himself at the head of the men of Moscow. He gained a
glorious victory, and the sword of the Poles was broken for
ever in Muscovy. That is the man whose name you bear, and
whose blood is flowing in your veins, Prince Ivan Pojarsky!”</p>

<p>“He was splendid!” said Ivan with kindling eyes; “I am
proud to bear his name.”</p>

<p>Petrovitch felt shocked by the disclosure of Ivan’s ignorance
of the history of his native country, that country which was to
himself the object of proud and passionate love.</p>

<p>“Can it be,” he said to him the next day&mdash;“can it be that
no one has ever even told you about the great Czar Peter?”</p>

<p>“I have heard of the Czar Peter,” said Ivan: “he ordered
all the mujiks to cut off their beards, threatening to cut off
their heads if they refused. ‘God will make your beards grow
again,’ he said; ‘but will he do the same for your heads?’”</p>

<p>Petrovitch built a long and interesting narrative upon this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
very meagre foundation of historical knowledge. He had little
Feodor for a listener as well as Ivan, and the intelligent questions
of the boys drew out the information he loved to impart.
Especially graphic was his account of the Swedish defeat at
Pultowa, and the horrors of the retreat that followed&mdash;horrors
that seem to have prefigured those of a yet more awful retribution
near at hand, though still wrapped in the mysterious veil
of the future.</p>

<p class="in0">Then, gradually bringing down the narrative to more recent
times, he told of the great Czarina Catherine&mdash;of the splendours
of her court and the triumphs of her arms&mdash;especially of the
conquest of Poland, in his partial eyes only a just retribution
for the past wrongs, and a glorious achievement of the prowess
of holy Russia. At last, though with some reserve, he spoke of
the short, sad reign of the Czar Paul. “God sent him for our
sins,” he said.</p>

<p>This reserve only piqued the curiosity of the boys.</p>

<p>“It is true he wrought much evil,” he admitted, in answer to
their questions; “but still his heart was good. It was his head
that went astray. Oh, my children, there are sorrows in the
world darker than you have ever dreamed of! Seems it sad to
you to sit as I do now, and see the beautiful light of God’s
world fading from me day by day? What is that to the desolation,
the anguish, when God lays his hand upon the immortal
light within and turns it into darkness? The Czar Paul was
not himself when he sent half his nobles to Siberia, shut up
his own son in prison and threatened his life&mdash;ay, even the life
of the Empress. His true self fought long against the demon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
that possessed him. Many a time did he listen to his son,
though he never loved him, when he dared bravely to plead for
and shelter the victims of his wrath. More than once he
said regretfully, after some unusual outburst of violence, ‘I
wish I had consulted the Grand Duke Alexander.’ But such
a state of things could not go on. The end came.”</p>

<p>“What was the end, dädushka?” queried Ivan. (Dädushka,
“little grandfather,” the term of endearment constantly used by
Feodor, was often adopted by Ivan.)</p>

<p>“Do not ask me of the end,” said the old man very sorrowfully.
“It was said in official proclamations, it is still written
in printed books, that ‘the Czar Paul Petrovitch died of
apoplexy.’ But all the world knows that is false. Some there
are, too, who will have cause to know it when they come to
stand before the judgment-seat of God.”</p>

<p>“He was murdered,” said Feodor with decision. “That is
what <em>I</em> have always heard.”</p>

<p>“Were the people sorry for him, or glad of his death?” asked
Ivan.</p>

<p>“Glad exceedingly. They were delivered from a reign of
terror. Yet there were men who loved the Czar Paul truly&mdash;who
love him still, and will take that love with them to
the grave. One such I know&mdash;my good friend and patron,
from whom I have received many favours, Count Rostopchine.
He kept proudly aloof from the court of the new Czar, would
hold no communication with him, and take no favour from his
hands&mdash;hands which, he dared to hint, were not pure from the
stain of a father’s blood. When the great battle of Austerlitz
was lost, Count Rostopchine said, ‘God would not prosper the
arms of a bad son.’”</p>

<p>“How angry the Czar must have been!” said Ivan. “He
ought to have sent him to Siberia, to repent of his insolence.”</p>

<p>“He did not send him to Siberia, nor have I heard that he
was angry. It is the guilty who are angry, and from that stain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
the soul of Alexander Paulovitch is white as the snow from
heaven.&mdash;Of the necessity of removing the Czar Paul from the
government, and placing him under restraint, there was no
shadow of doubt; and to that he had given his consent&mdash;<em>only to
that</em>. When he knew what had been done, his horror and anguish
were unbounded. At last he was not so much persuaded as
compelled to take up the blood-stained sceptre which the conspirators
laid at his feet. I saw him myself, on the day of his
coronation, yonder in the Cathedral of the Assumption, and
sadder face have I never seen upon living man than that young
handsome face of his. Often yet I seem to see it, and to hear
the very tones of his voice, as, kneeling before the altar, he
recited the solemn coronation prayer: ‘May I be in a condition
to answer thee without fear in the day of thy dreaded judgment,
by the merits and grace of Jesus Christ thy Son, whose name
is glorified for ever with thine, and with that of thy holy and
life-giving Spirit.’ God fulfil that prayer! Amen.”</p>

<p>A brief silence succeeded the sublime words, uttered so reverently;
but presently the old man <span class="locked">resumed:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Six short years only have passed since then; but I charge
you two, who are children now, to lay up in your hearts the
things that have been done in them, and to tell them to your
children and your children’s children. The Czar Alexander
Paulovitch has freed the Press, has abolished the secret police,
has refused to make use of spies. He has utterly forbidden
every kind of torture as a blot upon humanity. He has also forbidden
the confiscation of hereditary property.”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>“Dädushka”&mdash;it was Ivan who spoke now&mdash;“I do not understand
what you are talking about. What are those things
which you say he has forbidden?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
“Ah, child, I forgot. So little do you know as yet of wrong
and cruelty, that the story of the efforts to redress them falls
without meaning on your ear. But the young do well to remember
much they cannot understand. As for me, I was born
a serf, like my father and my father’s father; and these lips of
mine shall be silent in the grave ere they forget to praise
Alexander Paulovitch. Before his time we were bought and
sold like the beasts of the field. You might read a notice in
the window of a shop, ‘To be sold:&mdash;An active and capable
servant, and a good milch cow. Inquire within.’ This he forbade;
forbidding also the removal of peasants from the land.
He permits and encourages the nobles to set their serfs at
liberty whenever they will; and if they are without land, he
himself advances them money to purchase their homesteads.
He has deprived their lords of the dangerous privilege of sending
them to Siberia without a trial; nor dare any one, however
rich or great, use his serfs with harshness or cruelty. Amongst
many stories of his interference on behalf of the oppressed, I
remember one concerning a great lady, whose name I will not
tell you, as she lives in this city. From that love of money which
the priests tell us is a root of all evil, she neglected her sick
and aged serfs, and allowed them to suffer from want. The
Czar heard of it, and he sent his own physician to minister to
these poor suffering peasants, whom no man cared for. Dr.
Wylie&mdash;so they call him&mdash;a shrewd, clever Scotchman, took
care to order his patients so many expensive remedies and comforts
that the princess, by the time she had paid for wine and
wheaten flour, and I know not what besides, had also learned
the useful lesson that nothing costs so dear in the long run as a
duty neglected. Nor has the Czar given the mujik that which
costs him nothing. He refuses absolutely to grant men as serfs
to his courtiers; and thus he has dried up the unfailing stream
of wealth wherewith all the Czars that went before him have
enriched and rewarded their servants without impoverishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
themselves. God give it back to him in the prayers of the
poor! Moreover, I have heard that every year, out of his own
treasure, he lays by one million of roubles to aid in the fulfilment
of his beloved and cherished dream&mdash;to make the body of
every mujik on the soil of holy Russia as free as his soul is
already in the sight of God.”</p>

<p>The rapt, kindling expression of his face as he spoke thus
impressed the children deeply. He seemed to be gazing far
away into some “white starry distance” where he could see the
fruition of that glorious dream. But gradually the light faded,
and the shadow passed once more over the aged face.</p>

<p>“Who shall see that day?” he murmured sadly. “Not the
old; their work is quickly over, while God’s work goes on but
slowly. No, not the old; they are content to lie down in hope,
waiting for what God will let them see in the resurrection morning.
But the young.&mdash;He is young yet, this Czar God has
given us, whose youthful dreams are not of pleasure, or conquest,
or glory, but of loosing the heavy burdens, letting the
oppressed go free, and breaking every yoke. Shall it be given
to him to see the desire of his heart? It may be&mdash;before his
hairs are white as mine. But it may not. I have heard the
priests say that, after all, it was not Moses who led the children
of Israel into the Promised Land.”</p>

<p>Ivan and Feodor waited in respectful silence until his reverie
was over. Then Ivan began to question him upon a subject
about which he was interested, and indeed perplexed.</p>

<p>“Dädushka, why do you seem to think the Czar ought not to
have made this peace with Napoleon for which all the bells in
the city have been ringing?”</p>

<p>“There be many reasons, boy&mdash;good reasons and bad, noble
reasons and selfish. Of the selfish reasons I need not tell you.
You are now surrounded by merchants; you will soon be surrounded
by nobles. No doubt you will hear lamentations enough
from both&mdash;for the luxuries wherewith English commerce supplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
the tables of the one, and the gold with which it filled the
purses of the other. But what, perhaps, you will never hear,
is the truth that lies buried beneath that stream of idle talk.
Have you ever, in Nicolofsky, listened on winter nights to the
low howling of the wolves amidst the snow? There is a horrible
story I remember hearing in my childhood about a woman&mdash;a
mother&mdash;who was making a winter journey in her sledge with
her five little ones. Perhaps you too know the tale? The
famished pack with their demon voices howled around her
sledge. To save all the rest, as she fondly dreamed, she sacrificed
one child, her youngest. Then a moment of respite, a
verst or two gained upon the savage pursuers&mdash;a wild, fleeting
gleam of hope. Then&mdash;<em>then</em>;&mdash;but I need not go on. She
reached her journey’s end alone, to die the next day, accursed
and broken-hearted.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Forget the story if you can, but remember
the awful lesson. The taste for blood grows with what it
feeds on, and the doom of the coward only comes the more
quickly from his guilty efforts to avert it. The French are
wolves, and Napoleon is a demon. Already has he devoured
the nations of Germany, and it has but whetted his appetite for
fresh victims. He deceives the Czar&mdash;who is young, and likes
to think others as true and generous as himself&mdash;with his offers
of peace. But the peace he offers is only from the lip out; for
he hates us, and he will never cease to hate us. Why not?
We stand upright, while the other nations&mdash;all except the English&mdash;bow
down and kiss his feet. But they are all infidels,
those Frenchmen. They believe neither in God, nor saint, nor
devil. Therefore I think that if we had put our trust in God,
and gone to war with them again, he would have protected holy
Russia, the land of his people and of his orthodox Church.”</p>

<p>Old Petrovitch, in speaking thus, expressed the thoughts and
feelings of the mass of his countrymen. They were ignorant
and superstitious, but they were devout. They believed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
“the God of Russia,” and in the Czar as the first of his servants.
A time was drawing near when this belief of theirs should be
tried in the furnace heated seven times. The trial proved
beyond a doubt that metal was there, genuine and enduring;
but how much was the pure gold of faith, and how much the
iron of a fierce fanaticism? There is one test potent to divide
between the gold and the iron. The fanatic may endure like a
martyr and fight like a hero; but when the battle is past, and
the victory won, he will trample on the fallen like a tyrant;&mdash;for
his God is the God of vengeance. But while the man of
faith can suffer and fight, and that with a heroism as undaunted,
he can also pardon;&mdash;for his God is the God of mercy, and He
whose “right hand holds him up” makes him “great” with
“His gentleness.”</p>

<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_p.jpg" width="73" height="72" alt="" />
<span class="smcap1 p">Petrovitch</span> the merchant would have thought
himself greatly lacking in his duty towards Ivan
the boyar if he had suffered him to remain beneath
his roof. As soon as he had provided him with a
fashionable outfit&mdash;that is to say, an outfit composed of garments
fashionable in Paris three seasons previously&mdash;he transferred
him to the palace of a widowed lady of rank who had
promised to act as his guardian. He was to associate with her
sons, and to share with them the instructions of the French
tutor whose services were then considered indispensable to every
young Russian of noble birth. For these advantages Petrovitch
paid very liberally: in many families, even of the highest position,
good silver roubles were not as plentiful as they were
desirable, and were not likely to be rejected when they presented
themselves for acceptance.</p>

<p>Feodor was deputed to accompany Ivan to his new home,
since the elder members of the family did not care to present
themselves. It must be owned that the little Russian, in his
glossy blue caftan of the finest cloth and his bright silken sash,
had the advantage of his companion, who looked as awkward as
a naturally graceful boy could contrive to do with his limbs
confined in the tightest of French garments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
Having reached the stately painted gateway of the Wertsch
family mansion or palace, the two boys were admitted by the
porter and led across an ample courtyard into a large saloon
furnished in a manner utterly strange to Ivan. As no one was
there, he had time to indulge his wonder and curiosity. Chairs
and tables, divans and ottomans, with many other objects, of
the uses of which he had not the slightest conception, were
scattered about in profusion; the woodwork was painted rose-colour
or lilac, and lavishly adorned with gilding, while the
numerous cushions were covered with a kind of tapestry of a
shining gray. At one side of the room a row of slender shafts,
rose-coloured and tipped with gold, supported climbing-plants in
luxuriant flower; at the other, three large windows looked out
upon the terrace and the pleasure-grounds beyond it. Ivan
thought these windows were open, and was stepping confidently
towards one of them, when Feodor pulled him back with a
laugh. “Take care, Prince Ivan,” he said; “that is one great
sheet of glass. I have seen such before; they cost&mdash;oh, I know
not how many roubles. But come, let us look at the orangery;”
and he pointed to a trellised door at the farther end of the
room.</p>

<p>Here a fairy scene met their view. Oranges gleamed amidst
dark glossy foliage like “golden lamps hid in a night of
green;” heavy clusters of grapes, purple and amber, hung
high above their heads; peaches, apricots, and plums ripened
temptingly beside them&mdash;for in that ungenial climate many
fruits that grow elsewhere in the open air require the protection
of glass. Wonderful was the wealth of flowers, all of which
were new to Ivan. Sheets of blossom&mdash;gold, and purple, and
scarlet, azure, and creamy white&mdash;wooed his delighted gaze;
and ever and anon he paused as some rare peculiar beauty, rose
or lily, geranium or costly orchid, attracted his eye with the
richness of its colouring or the grace of its form.</p>

<p>But this was not the first “orangery” (all greenhouses were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
then called orangeries in Russia) which Feodor had seen, and
he had no objection to show off his larger experiences before his
senior and his superior in rank. He could even name to him a
few of the flowers. “Look here,” he said, as he paused before
a plant laden with clusters of graceful bells, their dark crimson
sheaths half concealing cups of white faintly tinged with rose-colour;
“that is called fuchsia. There is one of the same kind
in the Kremlin gardens. Last winter’s frost nearly killed it;
but it lives still&mdash;a thick, stunted, hardy bush, with little
red flowers, as unlike as possible to this one. That is like me,
and this one before us is like you, Prince Ivan. You are
going to be put in the orangery, because you were born a boyar;
while I am left outside in the frost and snow. After all, I had
rather be myself than you. It is hot here in the orangery,
and there is not room enough&mdash;one could not run or play in
comfort.”</p>

<p>He was about to try the experiment by indulging in a race
from one end of the tiled passage to the other, when a strange
figure was seen approaching them. It was that of a young lad
with flat, ugly Tartar features, and very fantastically dressed.
He was one of those Calmucks whom the Russian nobility had
a singular fancy for keeping in their houses as pets; although,
as they grew up, they often proved very troublesome to their
patrons. With a grin and a bow he informed the boys that the
countess was ready to receive them, and invited them to follow
him into her presence. Having passed once more through the
saloon, they entered a boudoir richly furnished and adorned
with hangings of blue and silver. An elderly lady, dressed
in exaggerated French fashion, reclined on a couch. Her
appearance was not improved by two rows of teeth dyed an
ebony hue, a curious Russian custom of the period. She
played with a fan, which was rather useless in that climate,
while she conversed in French with two gentlemen in frock
coats who sat near her. When Ivan entered, she languidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
extended her hand, glittering with jewelled rings, and addressed
some words to him in the same tongue. He looked embarrassed,
but the ready Feodor came to his aid. “Pas Français, madame,”
he said.</p>

<p>The Countess Wertsch accordingly condescended to the use
of her native language, in which she bade Ivan welcome cordially
enough. She then gave him a French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonbonnière</i>, and
told him to help himself and his companion to its contents,
while she continued her conversation with her guests. Ivan
could not help thinking, from the manner of the speakers, that
this conversation had reference to himself, and he was beginning
to grow hot and uncomfortable, when Feodor effectually diverted
his thoughts by taking out his pocket-knife and cutting upon
one of the bonbons&mdash;a large almond covered with chocolate&mdash;a
striking likeness of the countess’s rather peculiar face. He was
on the point of indulging in a laugh which might have had
awkward consequences, when a young man, dressed <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à la française</i>,
and carrying in his hand a long pipe tipped with amber,
lounged into the room.</p>

<p>“This is Adrian, my eldest son,” said the countess, turning
to Ivan. “You are to be fellow-students, so you ought to be
friends.&mdash;Adrian, this is Prince Ivan Pojarsky.”</p>

<p>Adrian made a bow, and addressing himself to Ivan, asked
if he had seen the new piece at the French theatre.</p>

<p>Ivan, who thought he meant a new part of the building,
answered with simplicity, “I do not know; everything I see
here is alike new to me.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall have the pleasure of introducing you to a great
many things,” said Adrian, with a smile, and, by way of a
further overture of friendship, he took out and presented a
jewelled snuff-box. Ivan supposed this to be another kind of
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonbonnière</i>; but fortunately for himself he was not attracted
either by the look or the odour of its contents, and declined
with thanks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
At length the older guests took their leave, and the countess
turned her attention to the boys. She seemed struck with the
appearance of Ivan’s little companion, and asked him many
questions, which he answered with a grace and sprightliness
that interested her still further.</p>

<p>“I should like to keep both of you,” she said to Feodor.
“Will you stay with me, and become my little page of honour?
I will have you taught French, and you shall be always with
your friend Prince Ivan.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, madame,” Feodor answered gravely. “But I
cannot leave my grandfather. I belong to him, and I will stay
with him always&mdash;<em>always</em>,” he repeated with earnestness.</p>

<p>“But, my little lad, your grandfather is very old. Some
day he will die, and then what will become of you?”</p>

<p>“When he dies, I will die too,” said Feodor resolutely, with
a glow in his dark eyes.</p>

<p>“Wait, boy, till you are ten years older,” laughed Adrian,
“and for no man in the world will you say as much as that.
As for a woman&mdash;well, I know not; you may have your fever-fit
like another, and get over it, and laugh at it.”</p>

<p>Feodor gave him a surprised, incredulous look, and repeated
quietly, “When he dies, I will die too.” Then, turning to the
countess, he took his leave in words he had been carefully
instructed to use: “May I be permitted to kiss your hand,
madame? My grandfather will expect me at home.”</p>

<p>She responded graciously, and asked Adrian to take him
into the orangery and give him some fruit. Ivan went with
them, being anxious to see the last of his little friend. They
passed a half-opened door, which the boys had not noticed
before. Within was a kind of oratory: sacred pictures glittered
in frames of gold and silver adorned with jewels, and
lights were burning before them in massive silver candlesticks.
Adrian turned in, but not to make his reverence, as the boys
supposed. On the contrary, he deliberately used one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
candles to light his pipe. Ivan and Feodor were both horrified,
and Ivan said, “How can you do that? The saint will be
angry, and some harm will happen to you.”</p>

<p>“My dear innocent babe, when you know a little more you
will believe a little less. Ah, here comes <em>Mousié</em>, our French
professor.&mdash;M. Thomassin, here is your new pupil, Prince Ivan
Ivanovitch Pojarsky.”</p>

<p>A dapper little Frenchman glided noiselessly towards them,
and bowed profoundly. But the ceremony of introduction
accomplished, Adrian went off with him, much to the relief of
the boys, whom he left in the charge of a servant, bidding him
supply Feodor plentifully with fruit.</p>

<p>That day was the beginning of a new life for Ivan. His
versatile, imitative Russian nature stood him in good stead.
Ashamed of his ignorance of what Adrian and Leon Wertsch
knew so well, and perhaps with the same feelings of emulation
towards them as of old towards Michael, he devoted his quick
intelligence and his retentive memory to two branches of study,&mdash;the
French language and the art of reading. The average
Russian is a remarkably good linguist, and Ivan was much
more than an average Russian. It very soon became unsafe
for “<em>Mousié</em>” to say anything in his presence which he was not
intended to understand; nor was it long before he could read
sufficiently well to amuse his leisure with the worthless sentimental
romances then, unhappily, popular in Russia.</p>

<p>In other ways his education made rapid progress. He soon
appreciated the attractions of the French theatre; he learned to
like the taste of champagne; and cards and loto were substituted
for the homely babshkys of his childhood. Under the tutelage
of M. Thomassin&mdash;as worthless and unprincipled a Frenchman
as ever professed and propagated the doctrines of Voltaire&mdash;the
Wertsches were growing up into frivolous, dissipated young
men of fashion, and open scoffers at what they styled a stupid
and antiquated superstition. Their mother, a thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
ignorant woman, with a thin veneering of showy accomplishments,
was a little horrified when their contempt for things she
had been accustomed to revere was manifested in her presence;
but she supposed that all must be right which was taught them
by a fashionable French “professeur.” At all events, they
only did like other people in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">beau monde</i>, and its opinion
was her idol.</p>

<p>Once only did Ivan see her really provoked. He often
visited his kind old friend Petrovitch, as indeed for every
reason he was bound to do. The easiest way of reaching or
returning from the merchants’ quarter was by crossing the
river, in summer by a ferry-boat, in winter on foot or in a
sledge. Once, however, just when the ice was beginning to
break, and the passage was difficult and rather unsafe, Ivan
stayed with the Petrovitches for dinner, and came home in the
evening in a drosky by a longer route. The countess, before
his return, had been a little alarmed for his safety, but was
much more annoyed when he made his appearance and explained
how his day had been spent.</p>

<p>“It is well enough to <em>visit</em> people like the Petrovitches,” she
said. “But to <em>eat</em> in their house! such a thing is never done
in the world&mdash;<em>never</em>! For Heaven’s sake, Ivan, do not let any
one know of it. You would be talked about.”</p>

<p>Adrian, who was present, took Ivan’s part. “After all,
mother,” he said, “in St. Petersburg his Imperial Majesty has
been known to drink tea in the house of a merchant.”</p>

<p>“His Imperial Majesty,” replied the countess with solemnity,
“had better take care of himself.”</p>

<p>“Which,” returned Adrian, “he is abundantly able to do.”</p>

<p>“Of course, Ivan,” Madame Wertsch resumed, “you can go
to the Petrovitches at proper times and in a proper way, when
the old man wishes to see you.”</p>

<p>“He will never see me again,” Ivan answered sadly; “he is
quite blind now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
One incident of his first winter in Moscow shocked Ivan considerably,
though it made scarcely any impression upon those
around him. Coming out at midnight with the Wertsches
from a sumptuous entertainment at the palace of a friend, they
found their little postilion lying dead in the snow, close to the
horses’ feet, with the reins still wound around his stiffened arm.
The child&mdash;a mujik of twelve years old, chosen for his beauty&mdash;had
fallen from his seat overcome by cold and fatigue, and the
coachman, himself half frozen, did not know what had happened
until too late to help him. Such accidents were of daily
occurrence, Ivan was told, during the frosty weather. No one
seemed to think much about it; he was only a mujik, one of
the “black people,” in the eyes of the fashionable world little
better than beasts of burden. But Ivan was haunted for weeks
with the dead face of the pretty boy, to whom he had often
given a few kopecks to buy sweetmeats. Another face came
before him too with a reproachful, accusing look&mdash;the face that
he had seen bending compassionately over the senseless form of
Stefen Alexitch. Ivan often looked for that face in public
places, in fashionable assemblies, in church; but it is needless
to add that he looked for it in vain.</p>

<p>About two years after his arrival in Moscow, Ivan made an
expedition to Nicolofsky to visit his old friends. Although
scarcely sixteen, he already considered himself, and was considered
by others, quite grown up. The young Russian of that
day ripened early into manhood: fifteen was a usual age for
entering the army, and education was then considered complete.
Still, though he thought himself old enough for any adventure,
Ivan might have postponed his journey for another year, had
not the proprietor of a neighbouring estate, who was going to
spend the summer at his country house, obligingly offered him
a seat in his carriage.</p>

<p>He had provided himself with gifts for all his friends, and
ransacked the “Silver Row” in the Great Bazaar for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
prettiest ear-rings and bracelets he could procure for Anna
Popovna. The welcome he received was everything that could
be desired&mdash;affectionate, enthusiastic, and admiring. There
was but one exception. Michael Ivanovitch scowled upon him
with undisguised ill-humour. He would like to know what
brought him there, he was heard to mutter; adding that the
less boyars and mujiks had to say to one another the better for
both. Otherwise, his visit was a complete success. He returned
to Moscow fancying himself desperately in love with Anna
Popovna, and the hero of one of his favourite romances, in
which princes sighed for shepherdesses and queens wedded
clowns. An attack of fever, which he had shortly afterwards,
and which kept him for some time confined to the house, gave
him leisure to indulge his dreams and reveries.</p>

<p>As he grew older, the works of Voltaire and Diderot began
to replace in his esteem the flimsy, unreal productions of the
novelists. M. Thomassin’s only genuine love was a love of
pleasure, his only genuine hatred a hatred of religion. Consequently
he taught his pupils just enough to make them sensualists
and scoffers like himself. He bid fair to succeed
as completely with Ivan as he had done with Adrian and
Leon Wertsch; indeed Ivan would probably go farther than
they, because his nature was stronger and his character more
energetic. What has no root is easily displaced. The religion
of Ivan’s early years was a mere superstition, a matter
of outward forms and observances; therefore, when he ceased
to attach importance to these, he lost everything. “From him
that hath not shall be taken away even that which he <em>seemeth
to have</em>.” There was no mental conflict, there were no keen
and bitter searchings of heart. From a dead faith he glided
almost insensibly into a dead scepticism, and by neither the
faith nor the scepticism had the profound slumber of his soul
been at any time disturbed.</p>

<p>He continued to attend the numerous church services because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
others did so, and because the exquisite music (in the Greek
Church entirely vocal) and the gorgeous ceremonial gratified his
taste. He also observed, at least as strictly as those around
him, the long and severe fasts of the Church; availing himself,
however, of such evasions as were sanctioned by custom:
“name days,” for example, which happened to fall in Lent
were sure to be honoured with a double measure of feasting.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his emotional nature craved excitement and his
mind needed occupation. Genuine, earnest study under a competent
teacher he would have thoroughly enjoyed; but the
Greek and Latin lessons with which M. Thomassin supplemented
his instructions in French were very superficial and
perfunctory. Fortunately he had another master for Polish
and German; and with these languages he took some pains,
because a knowledge of them was necessary in order to obtain
a commission in the army. But even in these his interest was
slight; for at present he found the attractions of the ballroom
and the gaming-table far more powerful than those of
the library.</p>

<p>The narrow world of pleasure in which he lived thrilled but
faintly to the shock of those mighty impulses that were moving
the great world around him. Now and then he heard the
strife of many tongues which accused the Czar of blindness for
having made peace with Napoleon at all, and of weakness for
keeping that peace in spite of numberless provocations. In
those days, any one who heard the talk of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salons</i> in Moscow
and St. Petersburg might have thought it the easiest thing in
the world to measure swords once more with the conqueror of
Austerlitz. Ivan shared the sentiments of those around him,
and accordingly he was overjoyed when at last, in defiance of
Napoleon, the ukase was published which reopened the trade
with England under the protection of neutral flags, and foreign
luxuries appeared once more upon the table of the noble, while
foreign gold glided quickly into the purse of the merchant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
He shared, too, the universal indignation at Napoleon’s
atrocious spoliation of the Duke of Oldenburg, the Czar’s
brother-in-law, perhaps the most flagrant of his many violations
of the Treaty of Tilsit. Ivan was breathing an atmosphere
highly charged with electricity, and full of the indications of
an approaching storm; but he knew not the signs of the times.
Besides, how was it possible that he, whom competent judges
were calling the best dancer in Moscow, and who was the
acknowledged favourite of fortune at all games of hazard, could
disquiet himself about the designs of Napoleon and the prospect
of a war with France?</p>

<span class="smcap1 y">Years</span> came and went, changing the “little lord”
of Nicolofsky into the graceful, handsome young
nobleman, the ornament of the ball-rooms of Moscow.
Ivan Ivanovitch&mdash;as he was usually called
by his numerous friends, such use of the father’s Christian
name being accounted the best style and the highest courtesy
in Russian society&mdash;had now completed his education. He
spoke French, the French of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salons</i>, in perfection; he
played the violin; he danced with exquisite grace; he was an
adept at cards and loto.</p>

<p>This last accomplishment was a dangerous one. Diderot’s
famous saying, “Russia is rotten before she is ripe,” had but
too much truth in its application to the higher classes. A
superficial foreign civilization too often covered without eradicating
the barbarism from which the nation was only emerging,
and thus the vices of the one state of society were added to
those of the other. In the brilliant circles where Ivan moved,
no form of vice was rare, except perhaps intemperance. The
noble did not usually misuse his champagne as grossly as the
mujik did his vodka; but this was the only particular in which
he set his poorer brother a good example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
The most fashionable vice of the Russian nobility at this
period was the perilous excitement of the gaming-table. In
this, as in other things, the licentious court of Catherine II.
had been to the whole empire a very seed-plot of corruption.
It is recorded that on one occasion the Empress herself had
been unable to obtain a glass of water, so engrossed were pages,
equerries, ladies-in-waiting, even grooms and porters, with their
cards and their dice. Things were altered now. Alexander
neither played himself, nor permitted any one to play for
money within the precincts of his palace; but when once evil
seed has been sown, who can eradicate the crop that springs
from it?</p>

<p>Adrian Wertsch was now a tchinovik; that is to say, he had
obtained a place under government which gave him an official
tchin, or rank, corresponding to a particular grade in the army,
the standard of all honour under the military despotism of the
Czars. Leon had a commission, and had recently joined his
regiment. Like every one else, he was greatly excited by the
prospect of the war with France; but, like nearly every one,
he thought the vast army Napoleon had been collecting was
intended to winter in Germany, and that the grand drama
for which all the world was looking with strained eyes and
eager hearts would not be played out until the following
summer.</p>

<p>About Ivan’s future there was some perplexity, but of a
kind which no one was in a hurry to solve. His education had
begun very late, and his present life of elegant dissipation was
very pleasant. Still, when Count Rostopchine became Governor
of Moscow, early in 1812, Ivan’s friends thought it well to
present him, acquainting the count with his position as the
penniless heir of a great though proscribed name. But
Rostopchine was a Russian of the old school, in whom the
proverbial “Tartar” was very near the surface. He surveyed
Ivan critically, from his perfumed hair to his silk stockings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
and jewelled shoe-buckles, and muttered contemptuously, as
he turned away, “Dandified French coxcomb!” To Count
Rostopchine the French, with all their works and ways, were
anathema.</p>

<p>Ivan’s heart was not broken by this repulse, though he took
his revenge for it in a clever lampoon, much applauded in the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salons</i>. He plunged the more madly into every form of excitement
and dissipation. For a while fortune continued to smile
upon him, and all things went well; his heart was glad, his
laugh light, and his step elastic.</p>

<p>But a bitter hour came at last. One night the debts scored
against him upon the gaming-table grew and grew, until the
total became absolutely alarming. Of course he was plied with
the usual arguments, “Go on; your fortune will change,&mdash;you
will retrieve all;”&mdash;and, of course, he yielded. The fascination
of companionship was upon him, and the yet more potent spell
of champagne completed his infatuation. So far as he was able
to reflect at all, the very thoughts that ought to have checked
his madness only stimulated it. He could not bear that his
associates should taunt him with cowardice, but it was still
more intolerable that they should suspect him of poverty. The
fear made him desperate, and he went on wildly and recklessly,
lavishly increasing his stakes, lest any one should surmise the
truth&mdash;that he was risking more than he possessed. But at
last that very fear arrested him when on the brink of ruin.
Seeing him so heavy a loser, his friends came forward with
offers of assistance, which they urged, nay, even pressed upon
him. But he rejected all. Not to these would he become a
debtor; for what hope could he entertain of repaying them?
There was only <em>one</em> in all the world to whom he could turn for
real help in the hour of need.</p>

<p>It was not until the next morning that he fully realized his
position. He awoke unrefreshed from a short feverish sleep,
and drank the tea his valet brought him, but could not eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Fortunes ten times larger than the whole sum of his debts
changed hands continually over the card-tables of Moscow and
St. Petersburg. But all things go by comparison, and what
would have been little indeed to the lord of broad lands and
toiling serfs, was much to the “merchant’s pensioner,” as Ivan
bitterly called himself. He had no alternative but to go to
Petrovitch, confess his folly, and throw himself upon the
generosity of his kind old friend. This, to a youth of his
spirit and temper, was a cruel humiliation. All his manliness,
all his independence of character revolted from the task; and
it was equally abhorrent to his pride. Both the good and the
evil in him were at war with the necessities of his position;
but both had to give way. He dressed himself quickly, left
the Wertsch mansion without speaking to any one, hailed the
first drosky he saw, sprang in, and gave his directions,&mdash;choosing
the longer route to the merchant’s house, that he
might avoid the ferry with its possible delays. The driver, as
he settled himself in his seat and grasped more firmly the long
ropes that served him as reins, leaned over and asked him,
“Gospodin,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> have you heard the news?”</p>

<p>“Curse the news!” said Ivan petulantly. “Drive quickly,
isvostchik,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> and I’ll double thy fare.”</p>

<p>Yet absorbed as he was in his sordid, selfish trouble, he
could not fail to see that some extraordinary change had passed
over the city. At the street corners and in the thoroughfares
persons of all classes were gathering in groups, talking and
gesticulating. A few had letters or printed papers in their
hands; but those who could read were a small minority, and
by far the greater number were discussing what they had heard
from the lips of others. Now and then Ivan wondered
languidly what had happened; but his thoughts always slipped
back to subjects of more pressing interest. What should he
say to Petrovitch? and what would Petrovitch say to him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
It was a glorious morning at the end of June,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“The very city’s self was filled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the breath and the beam of heaven.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Fair shone the gilded cupolas of the Kremlin, brightly gleamed
the silver Moskva, and the gardens and terraces were blooming
with a thousand flowers. Never had the old city looked more
lovely, with the strange peculiar charm of its quaint barbaric
magnificence toned and softened by those sweet influences of
sun and air that touch the responsive earth like the benediction
of Heaven. On that day Ivan scarcely noticed its beauty;
but in after years the memory often returned to him,&mdash;like the
last happy, untroubled look we have seen on some beloved face,
ere it is dimmed by those shadows of disease and pain that
prelude the darker shadow of the grave.</p>

<p>At length he reached the house of Petrovitch, dismissed his
drosky, and walked in. He was accustomed to enter the old
man’s presence unannounced, to be recognized by the sound of
his footsteps, and affectionately welcomed.</p>

<p>It was now almost four years since Petrovitch had become
totally blind. God’s hand had touched him gently, and the
touch softened and ennobled him. The interests of commercial
life, the buying, selling, and getting gain, which once occupied
him so intensely, had faded from him now; and if still he
ruled his household with a strong hand, it was less by fear
and more by love. Feodor had learned to read on purpose to
while away the long hours for him, though there were not
many books in the Prussian language likely to interest him.
For romances in the French style, whether translated or imitated,
he cared nothing at all; history, which he would have
greatly enjoyed, had still to be naturalized in Russia; and, unhappily,
the best Book of all was then locked away from the
Russian in a casket of which the key was well-nigh lost&mdash;the
old Slavonic tongue, more unintelligible to Petrovitch than the
English of Chaucer would be to us. But a friend of his, Pope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
Yefim, a priest of much more than average intelligence and
seriousness, used often to visit him, and to tell him Scripture
narratives, and repeat for him prayers or passages from the
Psalter. “I can no longer raise my eyes to the holy pictures,”
Petrovitch was wont to say, “so I must learn to lift up my
heart to God.”</p>

<p>To-day Ivan found him surrounded by several members of
his family. His eldest son stood before him; two or three
others, sons or grandsons, were at hand; and Feodor, now a
fine lad of sixteen, had perched himself as usual upon one of the
arms of his chair.</p>

<p>“Father, your will is law,” Ivan Petrovitch was saying.
“Still it is rather hard upon me to be chained to desk and
ledger because I am the eldest son, while sons, nephews, and
grandsons are doing their duty.”</p>

<p>“Thou too wilt be doing thine,” the old man returned.
“What if it be a harder one? Is it thy part, or mine, to
choose?&mdash;But hush! are not the footsteps that I hear those of
my lord’s grandson?”</p>

<p>Ivan came forward, and the usual greetings were exchanged,
though on his side in a tone of embarrassment, which did not
escape the quick ear of Petrovitch.</p>

<p>“Prince Ivan,” he said, “you are in trouble. Do you wish
to speak with me alone?”</p>

<p>Petrovitch usually gave Ivan the title of prince, although, on
account of his father’s disgrace and his own equivocal position,
the heir of Pojarsky had forborne to assume it in general
society&mdash;a modest reticence which Petrovitch not only approved,
but had himself actually recommended.</p>

<p>“It is true, dädushka,” Ivan answered frankly; “I wish to
speak with you alone.”</p>

<p>At a sign from Petrovitch the others left the room, and without
waiting for Ivan to begin, the old man said, “I know what
you feel. Speak freely. What can I do for you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Ivan was greatly surprised at this address. Which of those
who were present last night, he asked himself, could possibly
have told the story of his folly, and how could it have found
its way so quickly to the ears of Petrovitch?</p>

<p>“I do not think you <em>can</em> know what I feel,” he began
humbly; “I am so utterly ashamed of myself. You have so
often warned me to be moderate in play, and as often have I
made the best of resolutions, and I meant to keep them faithfully,
but&mdash;”</p>

<p>He came to a sudden stop, astonished, even terrified by the
change that swept over the sightless but expressive face of
Petrovitch. Disappointment, sorrow, anger chased each other
rapidly, like clouds before a stormy wind; then all these passed
away and were succeeded by something too sadly like contempt.
Ivan stood in silent embarrassment, unable to proceed with his
story.</p>

<p>But he had said enough. After a pause, Petrovitch spoke
in a cold, constrained voice, “So <em>that</em> is your trouble, Prince
Ivan? You have lost money at play. How much?”</p>

<p>“Eight thousand seven hundred and fifty roubles,” said Ivan
in the low tones of penitence and shame.</p>

<p>“Silver or paper?”</p>

<p>“Paper,” said Ivan, rather more cheerfully. There was an
enormous difference in value between the two, although in
neither case would the sum have been a large one in the eyes
of extravagant Russian nobles.</p>

<p>“Do me the favour to call Feodor; you will find him in the
next room.”</p>

<p>Ivan obeyed; and Petrovitch, taking a key which hung
round his neck, gave it with a few directions to his grandson.</p>

<p>Something in the old merchant’s manner made Ivan stand
before him in silence, without venturing a word of explanation
or of defence, until Feodor’s return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
The boy gave his grandfather a roll of bank-notes, clean and
crisp, and immediately left the room.</p>

<p>In perfect silence the old man handed the notes to Ivan,
who tried to express his thanks; but Petrovitch stopped him.
“The money,” he said coldly, “is a matter of indifference to
me. You are more than welcome to it, Prince Ivan.” Never
until to-day had he addressed him in such a tone.</p>

<p>Ivan drew near, knelt down before his chair, and took his
hand affectionately. “Dear old friend,” he said, “I see that
I have wounded you. Forgive me, for my grandfather’s sake,&mdash;and
for my own, for I love you truly.”</p>

<p>The aged face quivered with suppressed emotion, yet Petrovitch
drew his hand away. “You cannot love me, Prince
Ivan Pojarsky,” he said, “if you love not the land of your
fathers.”</p>

<p>“The land of my fathers!” repeated Ivan in surprise.
“What can you mean?”</p>

<p>“Stand up, Prince Ivan,” continued the old man, still speaking
with sternness; “the posture of a suppliant does not become
you. Do you think it is anything to me that you have
lost a few thousand roubles at play? Do you think that if
you needed my whole fortune I would heave a sigh or shed a
tear as I gave it into your hands? But it <em>is</em> a grief to me,
beyond sighs and tears, that trifles such as these should occupy
the heir of Pojarsky when the foot of the enemy is on the soil
of holy Russia.”</p>

<p>“<em>What?</em>” cried Ivan, springing to his feet in amazement.</p>

<p>“Can it be possible you have not heard?” asked Petrovitch,
the heavy cloud of displeasure beginning to clear from his
brow. “At daybreak this morning the tidings came. They
have crossed the Niemen, those barbarous hosts that own no
God in heaven, no king on earth save that monster from the
abyss they call Napoleon. They come&mdash;in the stillness and
darkness I seem to hear their footsteps across plain, and forest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
and river. They come to trample down the soil of our fatherland,
to water it with blood, to waste our fields, to burn our
villages with fire, to make our wives widows, our children
orphans; ay, and to do yet darker deeds than these, deeds
which I have no words to tell. The storm has been gathering
long; and now, at last, the thunder-cloud has burst upon us!
My country, O God, my country!”</p>

<p>“But our cause is just,” said Ivan. “Surely every Russian
will fight to the death.”</p>

<p>“This, indeed, will be a death-struggle,” Petrovitch resumed.
“Do you not understand? It is all the world against holy
Russia&mdash;all the world, except England and Spain: England,
far away, safe within her God-given rampart of crested foam;
Spain already bleeding beneath the talons of the vulture.
Russia, Russia only, stands upright, and refuses, as Pope Yefim
expresses it, to bow the knee to the Baal, or rather to the
Moloch of France. Therefore, the conqueror has forced the
conquered to join his standard, and it is not only the legions
of France who are pouring across the Niemen, but Prussians,
Austrians, Saxons, Westphalians, all the men of Germany who
are Napoleon’s subservient though unwilling slaves; Poles,
ever eager to trample on our pride and profit by our misfortunes;
ay, even Spaniards, dragged from their vines and
their olives to fight for the tyrant they detest.” He paused,
then went on again in a sadder tone and with even deeper
feeling&mdash;“If in this dark hour God had but been gracious to
us, and given us a bearded Czar!”</p>

<p>“A bearded Czar!” Ivan repeated in perplexed surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes. Do you not remember the words of the great Czar
Peter? ‘If ever again a bearded Czar shall sit upon the
throne of Russia, all Europe may tremble.’ He meant a true
Muscovite Czar&mdash;stern, hard, and strong, like Ivan the Terrible
long ago, somewhat like Count Rostopchine now. But
instead of such a hero as the Czars of old&mdash;with the world in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
arms against us, God in his inscrutable providence has seen fit
to send us Alexander Paulovitch.”</p>

<p>“But, dädushka, the people love him.”</p>

<p>“<em>Love him?</em>&mdash;with all their hearts. The men of Russia are
not wood or stone. They love him well enough to be true to
him to the death, if only he dares to be true to himself and to
them. But that is too much to hope. All things must do
after their kind. Does the antelope of the desert confront the
tiger in his den, and tear from him his blood-stained spoil?
Do men take the fine gold out of the furnace to forge it into
their weapons of war? or the silk of China to spin into the
cable that holds the ship of war to her moorings? But, Prince
Ivan, I am talking wildly, perhaps idly and sinfully. Forget
what I have said. After all, Alexander Paulovitch is the
Lord’s anointed.”</p>

<p>“And you know that, since last April, he has been in the
field with his army&mdash;where he ought to be.”</p>

<p>“Where he ought <em>not</em> to be!” thundered Petrovitch angrily.
“What we ask from our Czar is not the cheap courage of the
recruit, whose one virtue is to stand and be shot at, but the far
higher courage to think, to decide, to act for fifty millions of
men. ‘Thou shalt not go forth with us to battle,’ said the
men of old to their king, ‘that thou quench not the light of
Israel.’ God put the heart of man in the very midst of his
body, to send the life-giving blood to the strong hands, which
in their turn are meant to defend it from scath and harm.”</p>

<p>“True;&mdash;and it occurs to me,” said Ivan quietly, “that my
place is with the hands.”</p>

<p>The face of Petrovitch actually lighted up. “Thank God
for that word!” he said. “But I expected no less from Prince
Ivan Ivanovitch Pojarsky.”</p>

<p>Ivan had entered the house of Petrovitch that day a reckless,
frivolous youth, capable indeed of nobler things, but absorbed
in the pursuit of pleasure and in the petty, selfish troubles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
it entailed upon him. He left the presence of his aged friend
with the heart, the purpose, the thoughts of a man. He felt
the ennobling glow of patriotic fervour. His country was in
jeopardy, and he was ready to give his life for it. He thought,
as he turned his steps <span class="locked">homewards,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“This is enough to make my brave ancestor, the great Prince
Pojarsky, arise from his grave to fight for holy Russia. From
his grave? There are living graves, far off in drear Siberia:
will the dead arise out of <em>these</em>, I wonder? Dear, unknown
father&mdash;unknown, yet not forgotten&mdash;if still you see the sun
and breathe the air of this world, how would you rejoice to
come back and cover your stained name with glory! But I
scarcely dare to hope your life has lingered on through all
these weary years. If not, then mine are the only veins in
which the blood of Pojarsky is flowing. Oh that I could win
our ancient honour back again!”</p>

<span class="smcap1 a">About</span> three weeks later all Moscow was in a frenzy
of excitement. The Czar was coming. Ten thousand
bells, from those of the world-famous “Ivan
Veliki,” that looked down from its giddy height
upon the domes of the Kremlin, to that of the most obscure of
her fifteen hundred churches, were clamouring their sonorous
welcome. Cannon were ready to thunder a greeting yet more
deafening, though far less musical; and the nobles and clergy
were preparing a grand procession to meet their sovereign at
the Smolensko gate. Meanwhile the people poured forth in a
dense, tumultuous crowd to watch for his approach. Long and
patiently did they wait; and the shades had fallen deep over
the city, in which that night there were but few sleepers, when
at last continued shouts and “houras” announced his appearance.
Happy was he who could catch, through the darkness,
even a glimpse of the unpretending open carriage, drawn by
four unbroken horses from the steppes of Tartary, in which the
Czar was wont to travel.</p>

<p>It had been a bitter sacrifice to Alexander to forsake his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
armies, now face to face with the enemy, and retrace his steps
to the centre of his dominions. But his generals had said to
him, “Sire, your presence here paralyzes the army; it takes
fifty thousand men to guard you;” and he was forced to acknowledge
the justice of their remonstrances: a chance bullet&mdash;perhaps
a bullet which was <em>not</em> a chance one; for Napoleon
was no chivalrous antagonist&mdash;might at any moment leave
Russia a prey to untold confusion.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> On the other hand, a
new army was urgently needed, and none but the sovereign
could raise it; men’s hearts everywhere were failing them for
fear, and none but the sovereign could inspire them with hope
and confidence. So “the great heart” returned “to the midst
of the great body.”<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> For the present.</p>

<p>On the morning after the arrival of the Czar in Moscow,
Ivan was walking in a fashionable street called the Arbatskaya,
not far from the Kremlin. Adrian Wertsch and two or three
other young noblemen were with him. Like all the crowd
amongst which they were moving, they had donned their
richest and gayest dresses. Every one wore a festive air, and
seemed to be making holiday in honour of the presence of the
sovereign.</p>

<p>“Come, Adrian Nicoläitch,” said young Kanikoff, the very
person to whom Ivan had lost so many of Petrovitch’s hard-earned
roubles&mdash;“come, tell us how much of the show <em>you</em> saw
last night.”</p>

<p>“As much as you did,” was the laughing answer; “or as
our friend here, Ivan Ivanovitch.”</p>

<p>“Oh, as for me,” said Ivan, “<em>I</em> am born under an unlucky
star. I am destined never to see his Imperial Majesty. During
one of his visits to the city I was ill; during two I was absent;
and last night, all I could contrive to see was the head of one
of his horses.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
“Better luck another time. Stay, I really think we are
going to have it now. Hark! listen to those shouts. What
a throng there is though&mdash;all the ‘black people’ in Moscow
pressing about us!&mdash;Come, come, good people; if it is the
Czar, still you need not crowd us in this way. There is room
enough in the world for all. Stand back, I say!&mdash;Ivan, take
care of your purse!”</p>

<p>“No need,” laughed Ivan; “there is nothing in it.”</p>

<p>“Hush! he is coming. Off with hats and caps.&mdash;Yakovlef,
of what are you thinking? Do not kneel, man; he has strictly
forbidden it.”</p>

<p>“Great St. Michael!” exclaimed Wertsch in another moment,
“what a disappointment, and what fools we have all been
making of ourselves!&mdash;Be quiet there, good people, and save
your throats until you have something to shout for. That is
not his Imperial Majesty; it is only one of his aides-de-camp,
with some other person belonging to the suite.”</p>

<p>“Eh bien!” said Kanikoff. “It is no wonder the servant
was taken for the master. He is handsome enough for that.”
And he gazed in undisguised admiration at the splendid figure
of the young aide-de-camp, with his plumed cap in his hand,
and a galaxy of jewelled orders glittering on his breast, as he
bowed gracefully to right and left in acknowledgment of the
salutations of the crowd.</p>

<p>“That is Prince Ouvarov,” said Yakovlef. “You seem to
admire him.”</p>

<p>“Who could help it?”</p>

<p>“Not the ladies of St. Petersburg, at all events. It is said
he breaks a score of hearts every season. Once the Czar himself
read him a lecture; and I am told he answered, with the
utmost <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sang-froid</i>, ‘How can I help it, your Imperial Majesty?
The ladies are such fools about me.’ But would you believe
it?&mdash;in war he is the Archangel Michael himself. He led the
hussars at Austerlitz; and at Erfurt Napoleon asked, ‘Which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
is the brave general who punished my infantry so sorely?’ This
young gallant, as beautiful as a girl, and as daintily curled and
perfumed, stepped forward and said quietly, ‘Je, sire.’ ‘You
may not speak very good French, but you are a very brave
officer,’ said Napoleon, taking his hand kindly.”</p>

<p>“Have a care, Yakovlef. If the people hear us talking of
Napoleon, ten to one they will tear us to pieces.”</p>

<p>“Not they, while the Czar is here.&mdash;Ivan Ivanovitch, what
ails you? You seem lost in a dream. Wake up, my friend.”</p>

<p>Ivan started.</p>

<p>“True enough,” he said; “I feel in a dream. I am perplexed,
haunted, by the face of that man.”</p>

<p>“Of Ouvarov?”</p>

<p>“No; of the other who rode beside him. That tall, gaunt,
foreign-looking man. I have seen him before; I am sure of it.
But where? when?”</p>

<p>“I should think,” said Kanikoff, “that you would care very
little to see him again. He must ride out with Ouvarov on
purpose to illustrate Beauty and the Beast.”</p>

<p>“Ivan would like well enough to see him if he were ill,”
Yakovlef interposed. “That is the Czar’s physician&mdash;Dr. Wylie,
a Scotchman, very clever, but very ready with his lancet, they
say. He has been accused of cutting off a man’s head to cure
him of a headache.”</p>

<p>“The head of the man who allowed him to do it could have
been little loss to its owner,” laughed Ivan. Then he repeated
thoughtfully, “His lancet! I am sure I have seen him with a
lancet. Of what can I be thinking?”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by Feodor, the grandson of Petrovitch,
who pushed his way through the crowd to the group of young
nobles. The handsome, dark-eyed lad, in his blue caftan and
crimson sash, looked to no disadvantage amongst them. They
all knew him, and greeted him with kindness, if also with a
little condescension.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
“I am so glad I have found you, Prince Ivan,” said the boy
breathlessly. “My grandfather thought you would like to see
the benediction of the Czar with the holy picture. His friend,
Pope Yefim, is to take part in the ceremony, and he says he
can secure you a good place.”</p>

<p>Ivan gladly accepted the offer; and in the short conversation
that followed, the merchant’s son was able to contribute materially
to the information of his social superiors.</p>

<p>“Pope Yefim has seen a copy of the letter which the Patriarch
wrote to the Czar,” he said. “He was not able to come himself&mdash;for
you know, gentlemen, he is nearly a hundred years old,
much older than my grandfather&mdash;but he writes that it grieves
him to the heart he cannot see the face of his sovereign&mdash;that
face which is to him ‘as the face of Christ.’”</p>

<p>Neither speaker nor hearers were startled by the expression
which to us seems to border on the profane. But the
profanity was unintentional, and the passionate loyalty utterly
sincere.</p>

<p>Feodor went on&mdash;“He has sent him the sacred picture of
St. Sergius, from the Troitza monastery. You know, gentlemen,
that is the picture which the Czar Alexis and the great
Czar Peter carried into battle, and it always gave them the
victory. Though, my grandfather says, it is not the holy picture
that gives the victory, or even the holy saint, but God
himself.”</p>

<p>“Thy grandfather seems to be a wise man,” said Yakovlef.
“But I wonder what the Czar himself thinks of the matter.
People used to call him very enlightened, quite a philosopher,
a disciple at heart of Voltaire and Diderot. I warrant me
they are right, and he believes little enough.”</p>

<p>The last remark was intended for the nobles, but it reached
the ear of Feodor, who, to every one’s surprise, both understood
and answered it.</p>

<p>“The Czar,” he said reverently, “must believe very much in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
God, for he cares very much about the poor, whom God has
made.”</p>

<p>“God give him the victory over his enemies!” said Kanikoff;
and the little group responded with a hearty “Amen!”&mdash;for,
“beneath all the foam and sputter” of their light and careless
talk, it was true that “the heart’s depths boiled in earnest.”</p>

<p>Such a benediction as the Czar was about to receive is often
bestowed, in the Greek Church, even upon private persons who
have in view some important enterprise, or wish to offer some
particular supplication or thanksgiving. It is called a Molében;
and it would be a beautiful and touching ceremony, but for the
baneful influence of that superstition which too often leads its
votaries to worship and serve the creature more than the
Creator. Usually, most of the prayers are addressed to the
guardian angel, or to the saint with whose picture the votary
is blessed&mdash;the picture being then given to him as a kind of
talisman.</p>

<p>The benediction was to take place on the 27th of July, and
early in the morning Ivan entered the Church of the Assumption,
the sacred spot where the holy anointing oil had been
poured upon the head of the Czar. Pope Yefim had found for
him a quiet niche, from whence he could witness the whole of
the ceremony. He had room to stand or kneel: in Russian
churches the worshippers never sit, however protracted the
services may be. From his place of waiting he heard the
tumult, the shouts and cheering, which welcomed the Czar as he
approached. He knew that now he was ascending the “Red”
or “Beautiful” Staircase, by which, upon state occasions, the
Czars were wont to enter the cathedral; but he could not know
that he was “followed by an immense crowd, who wept, and
blessed him, and swore to defend his empire with their lives.”<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
He knew that now this Czar would take his stand, as other
Czars had done, upon the summit of the staircase, to allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
the people beneath “to see the light of his eyes;” but he could
not know as yet how profoundly the mighty heart of that people
was moved, “as the trees of the wood are shaken with the
wind.”</p>

<p>Clear and sweet as the song of angels rose the ringing treble
of the boyish choristers, who welcomed the Czar as he entered&mdash;“Blessed
is he that cometh in the name of the Lord!” The
violet robes of the bishop and the assistant priests&mdash;the flash of
innumerable jewels upon mitre, pall, and crozier&mdash;the faint perfume
of incense&mdash;the sparkling drops of holy water flung from
vessels worth the ransom of a king,&mdash;all these held the senses of
Ivan, and wholly filled for a time his imaginative and impressible
heart.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the man who was the centre of all this pomp, and
whose manhood for Russia in that solemn hour was more than
worth it all, stood reverently in his place while the officiating
bishop sprinkled him with holy water, or touched his forehead,
his lips, his breast with the sacred picture. As the eyes of
Ivan rested on that stately figure, peerless in its grace and
majesty, a kind of awe stole over him. All the old superstitious
reverence of the Russian for the Czar, who is “God upon
earth,” came upon him. It seemed almost an irreverence to
raise his eyes to the face of the monarch; he could scarcely dare
to do it.</p>

<p>But a “Gospodin Pomilvi” of exquisite sweetness from the
choir drew away his thoughts for a moment, and involuntarily
he glanced towards the spot whence the sound proceeded.
Then, once again he looked where all else were looking; and
suddenly a strange thing happened to him. As in a dream,
he saw&mdash;instead of the gorgeous, dimly-lighted church, the
gleaming vestments, the drooping banners&mdash;a green bank beside
a river, a group of peasants, a cold and rigid form, a noble,
compassionate face bending over it. He heard a voice that said,
in tones of courageous hope, “My children, this is not death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
We will save him yet.” For he knew that his boyar and the
Czar Alexander Paulovitch were the same. Only, it seemed to
him that now it was holy Russia that was lying numb and prostrate,
and that the Czar had pledged himself to save. He
would do it. From that moment Ivan never doubted it.</p>

<p>Besides the great ceremony of which the world was talking,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
another, known to one only, took place in the church that day.
Ivan drew out the piece of gold his boyar’s hand had given him,
and which, ever since, had hung round his neck. He kissed it,
and made a solemn vow upon it, “Faithfully to serve my Czar;
to live for him all my days; and, if God will, to die for him.”</p>

<p>Yet once more his eyes sought the face of his sovereign,
and never wandered from it until the service was concluded.
But little could he guess what was passing in the soul of which
that expressive countenance was sometimes the too faithful index.</p>

<p>Alexander’s own hand has sketched for us in a few slight
touches the conflicts of that period. Not then, nor ever, so far
as we know, did the thought of St. Sergius, or of any other
human mediator, interpose itself between his soul and the
Divine Presence. But for some time past he had been
wrestling hard in secret with questions which go down to the
very roots of a man’s being. Was there a God in heaven
whose ear could be reached by that cry from human lips,
“Gospodin Pomilvi”? And, if so, was he the “invented God,”
the “God afar off” of the deist and the philosopher; or the
God of the Bible, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ?
Already these questions were answered for him, almost with
assurance; but there still remained another. Would this God
hear and help a man who was kneeling before him on behalf
of fifty millions of other men whose destinies were committed
to his keeping? Would he deign to touch him with his hand,
to strengthen him with his strength? In those days the soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
of Alexander was feeling after God, if haply he might find
him.</p>

<p>The service over, Ivan repaired to the Hall of Nobles, as
one whose rank entitled him to find entrance there. He had
to content himself with an obscure place in the crowded assembly,
where he could not see the Czar, although he could hear
his voice. In a noble address, Alexander laid before his subjects
the full extent of the public danger. He concealed nothing;
the strength of the invaders, the position of the army, its
perils, its resources, its needs, all were revealed with a large-minded
candour which would have honoured the constitutional
monarch of a free people. In conclusion, he said that he
“regarded the zeal of the nobility as the firmest support of the
throne. In all times and on all occasions it has proved the
faithful defender of the integrity and glory of Russia.” Here
his voice thrilled, faltered with emotion, and he paused amidst
a universal cry that seemed to shake the massive roof and walls
of the grand old hall&mdash;“Ask what you please, sire; we offer
you everything.”</p>

<p>One of the nobles proposed the gift of a serf in every twenty-five;
but a chorus of eager voices interrupted, “It is not half
enough!” Finally, one serf in every ten, ready armed and
equipped, and provided for three months, was unanimously
voted for the service of the Czar.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>While all this went on, Ivan sat in his place, silent and sad
at heart. <em>He</em> had nothing to give,&mdash;nothing but his life; yet
that, perhaps, might count for something hereafter.</p>

<p>In the meantime, a scene equally significant was taking place
in the adjacent Hall of Merchants. Old Petrovitch repaired
thither with the rest, leaning on the arm of his youthful guide
Feodor, his eldest son, who ought to have accompanied him,
being absent at the time. “I cannot see the face of the Lord’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
anointed,” he said, “but I can hear his voice.” This assembly,
like the other, was densely crowded. Feodor contrived to find
standing room upon the edge of a seat; and from this vantage-ground
he was able to look over the heads of the throng of
grave, bearded merchants. “Grandfather,” he whispered, “the
Czar is not here; only the Governor.”</p>

<p>“God save his Excellency Count Rostopchine! Hearts of
steel, such as his, are sorely needed now,” the old man responded.</p>

<p>“But we can see <em>him</em> any day we like. It is the Czar we
want to see,” grumbled Feodor.</p>

<p>“Patience, boy; he is coming,” said one of the merchants
near them. “And, while we wait for him, it is <em>his</em> words the
count is going to give us, not his own.”</p>

<p>This was true. Amidst a hush of eager expectation, the
Governor rose and read aloud the address of the Czar “to our
ancient city and metropolis of Moscow.” It contained the same
explanations and appeals which at that moment in another
place were falling from his own lips; and concluded with an
earnest exhortation to prepare for “that defence which must
now shield the babe at the mother’s breast, and guard from
sacrilege the tombs of our fathers. The very existence of our
name in the map of nations is menaced. The enemy denounces
‘Destruction to Russia.’ The security of our holy Church, the
safety of the throne of the Czars, the independence of our
ancient Muscovite Empire, all call aloud that the object of this
appeal may be received by our loyal subjects as a sacred decree.
May the filial ardour spread itself from Moscow to the extremities
of our dominions; and a force will then assemble around
the monarch that may defy the thousand legions of our treacherous
invader. The ills which he has prepared for us will then
fall upon his own head, and Europe, delivered from slavery,
may then celebrate the name of&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Alexander!” The words sprang from the lips of Feodor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
Petrovitch, the youngest there, who spoke aloud the thought
that thrilled in every heart, and knew not that he spoke until
he caught the reproving looks of some of those around him.
In the meantime Count Rostopchine calmly completed the sentence
as it had been written&mdash;“Europe, delivered from slavery,
may then celebrate the name of <span class="smcap">Russia</span>.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had he concluded, when the Czar himself stood
amongst them, and with a few eloquent words wound up to its
highest pitch the enthusiasm of the audience. Amidst the
tears and acclamations which followed, the venerable chief of
the merchants<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> stood up in his place and subscribed his name
for the gift of fifty thousand roubles&mdash;two-thirds of his fortune.
Others gave in similar proportion; and Petrovitch was surpassed
by none in self-sacrificing liberality. Feodor, under his directions,
wrote his name upon the list of subscribers. When he
had done so, he turned to his grandfather&mdash;“Dädushka, I think
you must give the Czar something more even yet.”</p>

<p>“Even sons and grandsons?” said the old man, with a smile
that had in it a little sadness and a great deal of resignation;
“well, I shall not refuse.”</p>

<p>“<em>Even me?</em>” said Feodor, nestling close to him and putting
his arm caressingly about his neck. But Petrovitch did not
answer.</p>

<p>“The people were willing,” even beyond their power, so that
three days afterwards the Czar published a ukase, not to ask
for gifts, but to limit their amount. “The nobles literally gave
him Russia,” wrote the Sardinian ambassador to his sovereign.
“They melted into tears; in short, sire, there never was anything
like it. The merchants have given him ten million roubles,
and lent him fifty or sixty million.”</p>

<p>But the mass of the people&mdash;peasants, mujiks, serfs, who
tilled the soil&mdash;what part had they in this splendid outburst of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
loyal and patriotic enthusiasm? Napoleon expected that these
“oppressed and degraded slaves” would hail him as a deliverer&mdash;would
rise everywhere in revolt, and massacre their tyrants.
Very different was the fact. When the time came for the
serfs voted by the nobles to be levied from their estates, and
when the vast crown lands had also to contribute their proportion
of recruits, there was weeping and wailing in the izbas
of every village from the Neva to the steppes of Tartary. But
it was not, as in other days, the conscript who mourned his hard
lot, and his mother, his sister, his betrothed who made sore
lamentation over a separation probably life-long. It was the one
<em>not</em> chosen who mingled his tears with those of his friends and
parents, because he might not go and shed his blood for the
Czar and holy Russia. Glad was the young recruit as he donned
his simple uniform&mdash;a gray caftan, with loose trousers and a
crimson sash; and proudly did he wear on the front of his gray
cap the imperial badge, “a brazen cross surmounting a crown
over the letter <i>A</i>.” First and highest the cross, symbol of the
Christian faith; beneath that, the imperial crown of Russia;
again beneath that&mdash;Alexander.</p>

<p>But although putting himself, as he was wont to do, in the
lowest place, and when possible out of sight altogether, the
strong personal love with which Alexander had inspired his
subjects counted for more, in that hour of a nation’s conflict
and agony, than the traditional religious veneration of the
Russian for his country and his Czar. Well was it for Russia,
and for Europe also, that the Czar God had given her was
Alexander Paulovitch. It was not only that he had been,
since the beginning of his reign, “perfectly just as emperor,
singularly generous as man;”<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> not only that he was richly
endowed with all those brilliant and fascinating qualities which
take the eye and win the suffrage of the multitude. The secret
of his influence lay deeper. God had given him a gift more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
precious still. He had touched his heart with “the enthusiasm
of humanity.” This autocrat of fifty millions “loved
his brother whom he had seen,” even when as yet he knew not
the divine Father “whom he had not seen.” The hand that
toiled so hard to bring back the perishing mujik from his death-like
swoon was well used to deeds of beneficence. Of these a
hundred stories might be told: at that time they <em>were</em> told, not
only in the salons of St. Petersburg, but beside the stove in the
izbas of many a country village. Everywhere the mujiks said,
“Our lord the Czar loves us.” And everywhere, as long as the
world lasts, love will win love.</p>

<span class="smcap1 i">It</span> is the fair and pleasant land of France&mdash;a land of
corn-fields and orchards and sunny garden-plots,
where quiet villages nestle in shady nooks, and old
châteaux stand proudly amidst their sheltering
woods. You feel everywhere that this land has been for many
a century tilled and cared for by the hand of man; that generation
after generation sleeps in peace beneath the shadow of its
gray old churches. Long ages of toil and civilization have left
their impress here, and the present is the heir of a glorious and
venerable past.</p>

<p>Yet, perhaps no country has ever suffered more. War after
war has swept over it; cruel oppression made the Revolution a
terrible necessity; and, again, the excesses of the Revolution
made men forget the crimes of the despotism that engendered
it. And in the days of which we write there brooded over
all the portentous shadow of another despotism&mdash;almost crushing
enough to recall the worst days of Louis, falsely called the
Magnificent, and of his thrice-accursed successor.</p>

<p>Still, even in those evil times many a secluded nook seemed
to be hidden in the hollow of His hand, so quietly did it slumber
throughout all&mdash;escaping not indeed occasional suffering, but
anything like general ruin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
One such nook&mdash;a little pastoral village not a hundred miles
from Paris&mdash;had in its immediate neighbourhood a spot yet
more secluded, where a noble family of the “old <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">régime</i>” who
otherwise might have wandered homeless exiles from their
native land, found a welcome refuge. The simple four-roomed
cottage, with the vine trained over its tiny porch, would have
been an unpretending dwelling for the village smith or carpenter.
Yet few could have looked on it attentively, even
from the outside, and none could have entered it, without feeling
sure that its inmates inherited the traditions of centuries
of refinement and cultivation.</p>

<p>The morning sun of one of the earliest days of 1812 was
streaming into the little porch. The weather was mild and
beautiful&mdash;unusually so for the season. One person was enjoying
it thoroughly&mdash;a lad of about seventeen, who reclined in
the porch, intent upon a book, while the sunshine streamed
brightly over him, and the breeze gently lifted his soft brown
hair. The expression of his face was rather sweet than strong&mdash;his
forehead was good, his eyes large and dark, his mouth
well-formed and sensitive, but lacking as yet the look of resolution
that might come with riper manhood.</p>

<p>So absorbed was he in his book that he did not hear an
approaching footstep; but then it was a very light one. The
young girl who came out from the parlour to join her brother
was his senior by a year, and looked even more. She was tall,
but her slight figure was well formed and graceful. Her eyes
were dark, like her brother’s; and her hair a glossy brown,
very fine and soft. It did not wave or float, but was neatly
coiled about a head which might have served a sculptor for his
model. There was no weakness in the delicate lines of her
face, though there was much tenderness. Her complexion was
pale; but there was in her cheek a hint of possible colour,
which came and went with every passing emotion. No one
thought of calling Clémence de Talmont pretty, but in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
eyes of the few who loved her she was beautiful as the dream
of a poet.</p>

<p>“Henri,” she said, in a gentle but decided voice&mdash;“Henri.”</p>

<p>He looked up slowly, and said with a reluctant air, “Surely
it is not time for breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Mother has had her coffee, and yours is ready whenever you
wish for it. It is not <em>that</em>&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I had rather wait,” said Henri, ignoring her last words. “I
want to see the end of Pizarro’s expedition;” and he turned
over a page of his book.</p>

<p>“What are you reading?” asked Clémence, suppressing something
like a sigh.</p>

<p>“Les Incas de Marmontel&mdash;a beautiful book,” he added,
rousing himself. “Those old heathen monarchs, who lived for
their people, tried to make others happy, placed their glory
in being loved, not feared, <em>ought</em> to have had a better fate.”</p>

<p>“I think <em>you</em> might find a better book,” returned his sister,
with a slight tinge of asperity. “Marmontel was a friend of
the Revolution&mdash;a philosopher, a deist.”</p>

<p>“Ah, sister mine, you would rather see me reading the Confessions
of St. Augustine,” said Henri with a good-humoured
laugh. “But there is a time for all things; and I cannot
think ill of books that make me love God, and his beautiful
world, and the creatures he has made.”</p>

<p>“True, brother,” said Clémence earnestly and with a rising
colour; “only take care that the God you love is the God of
the Bible and the Church, not the God of the philosophers and
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">savants</i>. But”&mdash;after a pause, and with a change of tone&mdash;“but,
Henri, will you not run down to the village before our
mother leaves her room, and see whether there is any placard
on the Mairie?”</p>

<p>Henri closed his book and stood up, the anxiety in his sister’s
face reflecting itself, though faintly, upon his. “Why such
haste?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
“Babette told me this morning that she hears there is a new
‘senatus consultus.’”</p>

<p>Henri’s thoughts turned rapidly from the mild sway of the
Incas, of which he had been dreaming, to the iron despotism of
Napoleon, for him no dream, but a stern and terrible reality.
“If there were twenty conscriptions,” he muttered hastily,
“you know I am under age.”</p>

<p>“I do <em>not</em> know it,” Clémence answered. “The curé says
he fears all are liable who will complete their eighteenth
year in 1812. That is why I want you to go and see
whether the placard is there, before we alarm our mother.
But take your coffee first, brother. I will bring it to you, if
you like.”</p>

<p>She brought him a cup of fragrant café-au-lait, and a fresh
roll, prepared that morning by her own hands. He had just
begun to eat and drink when a voice from an adjoining room&mdash;like
her own, gentle and musical, but decided&mdash;called, “Clémence.”</p>

<p>“Don’t delay about the Mairie,” she said as she hastened in.
“I will tell our mother you are going for a walk.”</p>

<p>Grave, sweet, and dignified was the lady who stood at the
table in the little parlour. Her face was worn and pale; the
hair that appeared beneath her snowy cap was slightly silvered;
and in her demeanour something of antique stateliness
combined with the peculiar and inimitable grace of the old
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">régime</i>.</p>

<p>A dress of purple brocade, rich and stiff, lay on the table
before her. “Come here, Clémence,” she said; “I want to
make this dress fit you.”</p>

<p>But Clémence shrank back. “Oh no, no, mother!” she said,
with an air of pain.</p>

<p>“But yes,” returned Madame de Talmont, in a quiet,
peremptory voice. “Not a word, my daughter; it is
yours.” And seating herself, she took up a pair of scissors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
and began to rip off some antiquated trimming from the
sleeve.</p>

<p>Clémence felt almost as if a living thing she loved was being
hurt. Tears quivered in her eyes, and the colour rose to her
cheek as she laid her hand on her mother’s arm. “Mother,
listen to me,” she pleaded. “Do not touch that gown. It
would never suit <em>me</em>. Is it well, think you, that I should go
to mass on Sundays looking like a princess, while the few who
know of our existence know also that we have scarcely bread
to eat from day to day? Is it suitable? And besides, dear
mother,” she continued timidly, “you know I do not love gay
clothing. I do not think it becomes a girl who, however unworthily,
still desires and endeavours to lead a religious
life.”</p>

<p>“Be as religious as you please, my dear daughter,” said
Madame de Talmont, with a slight smile, “but be dutiful
also, and believe that I know how Mademoiselle de
Talmont ought to appear at mass much better than she does
herself.”</p>

<p>“Mother, that is not all,” Clémence resumed. “I had rather
keep that gown of yours all my life as it is now. It is part of
my childhood; and, mother dear,” she continued sadly, “there
is so little of our childhood left to Henri and me. One of
the earliest things I can remember is your showing that dress
to me and telling me how my father brought it home to you the
first time he went to Paris after his marriage, and how you
wore it when you stood at the window of our old château
in the Bocage, and watched him as he rode out with his men
to join the Royalists.”</p>

<p>“The last time I ever saw him&mdash;until I stood beside his
death-bed. Ah, my child! that war in La Vendée has broken
many a woman’s heart.”</p>

<p>“Still, mother, it was a <em>just</em> war. My father did well to die
for his King.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
“That is understood. My children and I have a consolation
denied to those whose dear ones perish every day in the frightful
wars of this Corsican usurper.&mdash;But do not trouble thy
heart about the old gown, Clémence. Silk and brocade and
such things fade and perish and are lost; but thy father’s
last look as he rode away&mdash;<em>that</em> remains, <em>that</em> is mine for
ever. Does not the Bible say that ‘the things which are
seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are
eternal’?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but&mdash;is <em>that</em> what it means, mother?”</p>

<p>“That may not be all it means, but it may mean that too.”</p>

<p>Clémence yielded. She was accustomed to give way to her
mother; and indeed it is not usually the strong in heart who
dispute pertinaciously about trifles,&mdash;like good soldiers, they
reserve their fire until the right moment. A consultation
followed; and certain mysteries of cutting and placing, of
letting out and taking in, were decided upon and arranged.
While they were discussing the pattern of the sleeves,
Madame de Talmont paused to ask, in a kind of parenthesis,
“What has become of Henri? I have not seen him this
morning.”</p>

<p>“He has gone for a walk.”</p>

<p>No more was said until the ladies had entered upon the
mechanical part of their task, and deft, skilful fingers were busy
with needles and thread. Then Madame de Talmont resumed,
“Is it a fancy of mine, or is it true, that Henri becomes every
day more like our cousin Louis?”</p>

<p>“That, of course, I cannot tell,” Clémence replied, smiling,
“since, as you are aware, mother, I have never seen Cousin
Louis; though I find it hard to believe that. From my earliest
childhood I have thought of him and pictured him, until he has
become a kind of friend to me&mdash;like the saints, or the holy
recluses of Port-Royal.”</p>

<p>“He was no saint, my daughter,” returned Madame de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Talmont rather bitterly. “And an evil friend he proved himself
to thy dear father.”</p>

<p>“Yet, mother, he must have been one of the most lovable of
men.”</p>

<p>“He was fascinating, I do not deny. Besides, he was the
head of our house&mdash;or, at least, he became so on the death of
his father. And thy father could never forget that his own
orphaned childhood and youth had been protected by the parents
of Louis, and surrounded with an atmosphere of love and tenderness.
Often has he talked to me of his happy boyhood at
Vernier, where he and his cousin Louis were like brothers, and
Victoire was the cherished sister of both.”</p>

<p>“Cousin Victoire! Ah, mother, I wish you would tell me
more about her. I have always felt such a romantic interest
in this beloved and beautiful sister of Cousin Louis, and yet,
somehow, I know very little about her.”</p>

<p>“There is little to know, child,” said the mother, with perhaps
a shade of embarrassment.</p>

<p>“One thing perplexes me,” Clémence resumed thoughtfully.
“I remember to have heard you say that for generations the
first daughter of our house has been always called Victoire.
Now, <em>I</em> am not Victoire. Nor do I bear your name, mother,
nor that of my father’s mother, Léonie.”</p>

<p>“Child, ere thou wert born, the name Victoire had become a
sound of woe to thy father’s ear. Once, perhaps, it may have
been too sweet;&mdash;I cannot tell. Brought up together as they
were, and with the grateful, reverential love he bore to all the
De Talmonts of Vernier, it would have been but natural if&mdash;Still,
when all things changed&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mother, how was it that they changed so sadly? What
could Cousin Victoire have done to grieve my father? As for
Cousin Louis, I know that he became a Jacobin, a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonnet
rouge</i>.”</p>

<p>“Too true. Louis de Talmont&mdash;the child of a family of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
unstained honour and unshaken loyalty, the nephew of the
gallant prince who died so nobly on the scaffold for his King<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>&mdash;betrayed
every sacred memory of the past, every holy hope
for the future. I marvel that the dust of his ancestors did not
rise from the battle-fields of their country to curse the wretch
who bore part in the murder of his King.” A red glow suffused
the pale cheek of Madame de Talmont as she spoke, showing
how hotly the fire of passion burned beneath its covering of
proud and dignified self-control. With this lady of the old
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">régime</i> the affections of the heart were strong, but the traditions
and prejudices of a class were stronger yet.</p>

<p>“But Victoire?” Clémence ventured after a pause.</p>

<p>“Ah, Victoire! Poor child! she was more sinned against
than sinning. But her life was wrecked; and that sin lies at
the door of Louis de Talmont. In those early days of the
Revolution many foreigners came to Paris. With one of these,
who was young, brilliant, wealthy, and noble, Louis formed,
after his fashion, a violent friendship. M. le Prince, as we used
to call him, had a fine figure, a handsome face, and the most
splendid diamonds I have ever seen. But <em>there</em> was an end of
his perfections; and great as they may have been, they could
scarcely atone for a head and heart as empty as air. Being a
stranger, with nothing to lose, and no knowledge of our past to
restrain him, he went farther than even his misguided teachers.
There was no excess of the mob, in those evil days, in which
he did not bear a part. In the Jacobin halls his voice was
the loudest, his counsel the most violent; and ever on his
lips was that misused, delusive cry, ‘Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.’
It was to this man that Louis de Talmont must
needs give the hand of his sister, the cherished daughter of his
house.”</p>

<p>“Poor Victoire! How terrible for her! How miserable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
she must have been! And this foreign prince&mdash;did he perish
on the scaffold, like our Cousin Louis?”</p>

<p>“No; he escaped that fate. When the storm he and his
friends had evoked passed beyond their control, and the Revolution
began to devour its own children, he found safety in
flight.”</p>

<p>“And Victoire?”</p>

<p>“His wife went with him. I believe he took her to his own
country. It is but justice to say that he seemed to love her well.
But her place here knew her no more; she has been dead ever
since to all who held her dear. Her name has passed into
eternal silence. And when God gave you to us, your father
said to me, ‘M’amie, for many years now the world has been
talking of nothing but peace and love and the universal brotherhood
of man; but because in the brotherhood of man men have
forgotten the Fatherhood of God, their peace is ending in war,
and their love in hatred such as earth has seldom seen. By
the time this babe is a woman grown, perhaps once again the
world will have tired of war and <em>victory</em>’ (only in this way did
he utter the name), ‘and may be glad to be reminded of the
existence of such things as clemency and forgiveness; so I propose
that we call the daughter of our house Clémence.’ Accordingly,
Clémence you are.”</p>

<p>“It is quite right, mother. I like my name. Clemency
should always follow victory.&mdash;Ah! there is Henri. His step
is tired and slow.”</p>

<p>Henri came in, and in the old ceremonious way kissed his
mother’s hand and asked after her health. But the look that
passed between them showed that although Madame de Talmont
loved both her children intensely, her son was the very joy of
her existence; while on his part, the love of his mother was
the strongest passion that had yet found entrance into his
young heart. His face was pale and anxious; indeed it wore
almost an expression of terror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
“What is the matter?” his mother asked presently.</p>

<p>“Nothing particular,&mdash;nothing much,” said Henri.</p>

<p>“Whatever it is, speak, my son,&mdash;and at once,” said Madame
de Talmont imperatively.</p>

<p>“There is a placard on the Mairie announcing that the drawing
for the conscription is to take place next Thursday. It is
as the curé told us: all are liable who will be eighteen in the
course of the year.”</p>

<p>Both his hearers grew pale, and the work fell from their
hands. After a short pause his mother said, “It is plain you
will have to attend. God grant you may draw a good number.
But, at all events&mdash;” She remained silent for some moments,
then she added, in a voice which struggled hard to be calm,
“Bring me my desk, Clémence; we must be prepared for the
worst.”</p>

<p>Clémence obeyed mechanically, while Henri stood silent and
listless, watching her movements.</p>

<p>“Henri,” resumed Madame de Talmont, “I am going to
write to our good friend Grandpierre. <em>Should</em> the worst happen,
you must escape, and go to him through the forest. He will
shelter you.”</p>

<p>“But, mother, mother”&mdash;the lad’s colour came and went, and
a quiver ran through his frame&mdash;“the risk is terrible.”</p>

<p>“To <em>him</em>? He will venture it, for the House of Talmont,
for his King, and for his God.”</p>

<p>“To us all. Do you know how they deal with the <em>refractory</em>,
as they call those who try to evade the conscription, and with
their families?”</p>

<p>Madame de Talmont raised her thin hand with a peremptory
gesture, “Not another word, Henri. It concerns not thee or
us to measure the danger; the duty is all with which we have
to do. I can bear to think of thee pining on bread and water,
with a bullet chained to thy foot, and thy head shaved like a
convict’s; I could <em>not</em> bear to know thee in the camp of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Corsican tyrant, fighting to fasten his iron yoke upon the necks
of free men. How could I look upon thy father’s face in
heaven, if I had reared and nourished his son for <em>this</em>?”</p>

<p>“But oh, mother, it is <em>you</em> I think of&mdash;you and Clémence.”</p>

<p>“Whatever cross God lays upon us he will give us strength
to sustain. Go, my children, and pray to him. I must be
alone while I write this letter, for it will need to be very cautiously
but very distinctly worded. The posts are not safe.”</p>

<span class="smcap1 c">Clémence</span> went into her own room, and Henri
followed her. The chamber was severely simple,
but scrupulously neat. The narrow bedstead might
have suited a nun, and the table and chairs were
of unpainted deal: but an ivory crucifix, exquisitely carved,
hung over the bed; and the white-washed wall was adorned
with a little tier of book-shelves, constructed by Henri, and
containing a select and precious library&mdash;the “Augustinos”
of Jansenius, the works of Arnauld, Nicole, and other divines
of the school of Port-Royal, the sermons of Fénélon, and the
letters of Madame Guyon. Most precious of all was De Sacy’s
translation of the New Testament; and next to this inestimable
treasure, the volume best beloved and most carefully studied
by Clémence was the Port-Royal edition of the “Pensées de
Pascal.” Many a line, marked by the hand of the thoughtful
young student, showed her sympathy with the soul of the great
teacher. Her heart, like his, had turned from all that earth
could give to seek a more enduring rest and a better portion.
Had she found it? At least she had found much that was
unspeakably precious&mdash;a God to be loved and served with all
her mind, with all her soul, and with all her strength. But
she had been taught to dwell rather upon his commandments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
than upon his gifts, and was still far from recognizing, with St.
Augustine, that he himself must give that which he commands.
She had seen the mystery of the cross, but dimly and afar off,
reading therein rather the exceeding sinfulness of the sin that
had to be atoned for, than the unutterable greatness of the love
that atoned for all. Consequently, her religion was one of surrender
and renunciation, not of joyous acceptance and activity;
death to the flesh was her watchword rather than life in the
Spirit. The air she breathed was bracing and invigorating, but
it was cold and sunless. If it were the will of God that Henri
should become a hunted fugitive, that he should be arrested as
“refractory,” and should perish miserably in a fortress dungeon,
there was nothing for her to say but this, “It is the Lord; let
him do what seemeth him good.” And having said it, she
would still be an unprofitable servant. Her heart, it is true,
would be broken; but what mattered that to any one?</p>

<p>While such thoughts passed through the mind of Clémence,
Henri stood in silence, leaning against the little latticed
window, and looking out upon the peaceful country landscape.
At last he spoke. “They are gay enough in the village,” he
said. “They do not seem to dread the conscription half so
much as they did last year. In fact, this new war is very
popular. Mathieu Féron, who was standing in his father’s
forge when I went by, said <em>he</em> would be glad to be drawn; and
Jacques Bonin, and that other lad who is with him, were of the
same mind, saying they would like nothing better than to go
and give the Russians a good beating.”</p>

<p>“What miserable folly!” said Clémence with bitter sadness.
“What have the Russians done to us, that the blacksmith’s son
and the butcher’s boys of Brie should be eager to go and kill
them?”</p>

<p>“I daresay you know as well as they do,” returned Henri.</p>

<p>“‘It is in his heart to pluck up and to destroy kingdoms not
a few,’” Clémence quoted. “But, Henri,” she added, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
sudden gleam of hope, “may not good for us spring out of this
madness of theirs? Might we not, even if you draw a bad
number, find a substitute? You know there is nothing we
would not part with to raise the money&mdash;<em>nothing</em>.”</p>

<p>Henri shook his head. “Last time,” he said, “the price
went up to three thousand francs, and beyond it. Indeed, it
was difficult to get one at any price. But that is not all,”&mdash;he
lowered his voice: “Clémence, I have reason to think M. le
Maire means no good to me.”</p>

<p>She started. “Why do you say that?” she asked, with a
quick fading of the new-born hope.</p>

<p>“Quietly as we have lived here,” Henri resumed, “we are
not quite unknown. Every one is aware that I am the son of
Henri Charles de Talmont, who died for his King in La Vendée.
I have no favour to hope. On the contrary, I think M. le
Maire would be glad to see me with a musket on my shoulder.”</p>

<p>“If that be the case,” Clémence returned sadly, “at least
we may thank God that he cannot tamper with the numbers.”</p>

<p>“The numbers we are to draw? They matter less than
you think. The lists <em>must</em> be filled up; and so many young
men have been taken already that few enough are left
to choose from now. In any case, our little village will
have to contribute its full quota; and even should <em>I</em> succeed
in escaping, some other luckless lad will have to go in my
place.”</p>

<p>“It is not the misfortune of serving as a soldier that you
want to escape, but the dishonour, nay the sin, of serving a
usurper.”</p>

<p>“But, Clémence”&mdash; He paused.</p>

<p>“Well, brother?”</p>

<p>“It is no sin to fight for France,&mdash;for France, not for
Napoleon.”</p>

<p>“There is no France,” Clémence returned proudly&mdash;“no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
France that we can recognize apart from the King of France,
Louis Dix-huit.”</p>

<p>“Of whom <em>I</em> know no more than Féron or Bonin knows of
the Emperor of Russia.”</p>

<p>“What does that matter? What do you mean, Henri?”</p>

<p>“That we think Féron and Bonin a couple of fools because
they are longing to go and destroy the Emperor of Russia,
about whom they know nothing. Are <em>we</em> so much wiser if we
let ourselves be destroyed for a king of France about whom we
know just as little?”</p>

<p>“Not for <em>a</em> king of France, but for <em>the</em> King,” Clémence
answered gently. “And not alone for the King, but for truth,
and loyalty, and God.”</p>

<p>No more was said; for at that moment they heard the voice
of Madame de Talmont, who, having finished her letter, called
her daughter to read it. Henri stood yet beside the window;
but it was not the quiet wintry scene without which was
passing before the boy’s anxious eyes. He saw instead his
mother’s peaceful home invaded by ruthless soldiers; he heard
the clank of their spurs, the tread of their feet upon the stair,
their oaths, their threats as they sought everywhere for him,
the fugitive. He saw&mdash;he heard much more&mdash;his dwelling
given over to pillage&mdash;<em>that</em>, perhaps, might be borne; but his
mother, his sister, exposed to all the wrongs and insults a
lawless soldiery could inflict, and <em>had</em> inflicted in like cases!
No; he could not risk it. Not for all the kings of France that
ever wore a crown! Better serve Napoleon&mdash;better a thousand
times! And, after all, what was Napoleon&mdash;what were
emperors and kings, to him and his? What was death on the
battle-field? He had always heard that such a death was
honourable and noble, and at all events a man could die but
once. But the deserter’s fate was only terrible; suffering
without glory, “the pang without the palm.” From those
dreary fortress prisons where the “refractory” toiled in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
garb of convicts, fed on bread and water, with shaven heads
and fettered feet, no man ever came forth alive.</p>

<p>Days wore on, bringing the dreaded morning that was to
decide the fate of the conscripts. Madame de Talmont wrapped
her mantle around her and took the arm of her son. Clémence
also was prepared to accompany them to the village.
Henri, who looked very pale, attempted a remonstrance. “The
place will be crowded to-day,” he said. “It is not fit for <em>you</em>,
mother, or for Clémence.”</p>

<p>But they would not listen. “There is no country lad,” said
his mother, “who will not have his people with him to-day to
learn his fate; and shall De Talmont go to the drawing alone,
as if no one cared for him?”</p>

<p>As they passed along, they could not avoid hearing the mocking
remarks which were exchanged by the peasants of Brie when
they saw the proud aristocrats, whose lives had flowed on for
years beside yet apart from their own, forced at last into fellowship
with their neighbours by a common hope and fear. The
silk of Madame de Talmont’s mantle, well-worn yet unmistakably
elegant, rubbed against the homespun gown of the baker’s
widow, and both faces were pale with one anxiety.</p>

<p>“Ah, madame, there’s little chance for us this time,” said
Widow Simon. “<em>They</em> like it, the young folk. <em>They</em> know
no better. But God help the old!”</p>

<p>A crowd of women were standing together in the town
hall, while the young men went inside into the mayor’s office to
draw each his number from the box. Without, in the village
street, a band was playing martial airs, and people were shouting,
“Vive l’Empereur!”</p>

<p>Every minute or two some one came out of the office, swaggering
or downcast, as the case might be. Widow Simon’s son
had drawn a very high number, which made him comparatively
safe; and Madame de Talmont felt glad ever afterwards that
she congratulated the mother. Mathieu Féron came out waving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
his cap triumphantly, and shouting, “Vive l’Empereur! I
am going to fight the Russians! Hammer and tongs, good-bye!”</p>

<p>Then Henri came. He was calm, but a few shades paler
than before. He showed his number&mdash;<em>eleven</em>. No one spoke;
but a moment after Clémence touched his arm and whispered
hurriedly, “Come out into the air. Our mother is growing
faint.”</p>

<p>“Let us go home,” said Madame de Talmont, sighing heavily.
The crowd was increasing every moment, and the din and
tumult were deafening. With some impatience Henri pushed
aside those who stood in his path, and there was a sharp ring
in his voice as he said, “Make way, make way, good people!”</p>

<p>“Oh yes; make way for the new conscript. How well M.
de Talmont will look in the awkward squad!” cried some
one.</p>

<p>Féron had crossed the street to the little inn opposite the
Mairie, and was about to drink the Emperor’s health in a cup
of good red wine, a practice much in favour with the conscripts,
but before tasting it he pushed through the throng, and offered
the brimming goblet to Henri. “Drink, M. de Talmont,” he
said. “We are all comrades now, and the sooner we learn good
fellowship the better.”</p>

<p>Henri pushed the cup aside without a word; but Clémence
spoke gently to the village lad. “It is not that my brother
would not drink with you, Mathieu,” she said; “but he is
troubled just now, and so are we&mdash;like your mother and your
sisters.”</p>

<p>No other word was spoken until the De Talmonts reached
their home, and even then very few. Madame de Talmont and
Clémence arranged everything, and Henri seemed quite passive
in their hands. According to their plan, he was to leave the
cottage after nightfall, and travelling on foot by unfrequented
ways, to try to reach the neighbourhood of their old home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
in the Bocage, where the faithful Grandpierre, who had been
their father’s steward, would receive and protect him. A
little money and a change of linen were concealed about his
person, but on no account must he look like a traveller. So
long had Madame de Talmont contemplated the necessity for
this journey that she was able to give her son the fullest and
clearest directions.</p>

<p>At length all was done. The last meal was eaten together,
or at least a pretence was made of eating it. Henri embraced
his mother, and received her parting blessing; then Clémence,
wrapping a shawl around her, said, “The night is fine; I will
go with you to the stile of the far corn-field.”</p>

<p>They walked along in silence. They had worlds to say to
each other, and this might be their last opportunity on earth,
yet neither found a word. Not until the parting-place was
reached did Clémence whisper, as she slipped a purse into her
brother’s hand, “There are five napoleons, Henri; you will be
sure to want them. And oh! write to us as soon as you can.
I will try to cheer and comfort our mother. Just one word
more, dearest of brothers. Pray to God, seek to have him for
your friend; then, whatever happens”&mdash; But here her voice
failed utterly.</p>

<p>Henri threw his arms around her, and his voice was hoarse
and changed, very unlike his own. “Clémence,” he said, “promise
me one thing.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That, <em>whatever happens</em>, you will not hate or curse me, or
call me traitor, but forgive and love me still; that you will
plead with my mother to forgive <span class="locked">me”&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Forgive you! love you still! What can you mean, Henri?
It is not possible we should ever change to each other. Not&mdash;<em>possible</em>,”
she sobbed, clinging to him, and straining him to her
heart in an embrace that seemed as if no power on earth could
sunder it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Somehow or other Henri freed himself at last. He said in a
kind of choked whisper, “Remember my words. Good-bye,
and God&mdash;your God&mdash;bless you.” One last lingering look, and
he turned away, ran quickly down the sloping corn-field, and
was soon lost to sight.</p>

<p>But he did not take the path that Clémence supposed. He
returned to the village by a circuitous route, and about midnight
tapped gently at the curé’s door. The priest was
evidently on the watch, for he opened the door and admitted
him at once, then shut and bolted it, and extinguished the
light he had kept burning in his window as a guide to his expected
guest.</p>

<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_i.jpg" width="73" height="72" alt="" />
<span class="smcap1 i">It</span> was evening in a crowded barrack-room in Paris.
Recruits, not yet clad in uniform, but wearing the
blouses or the coarse fustian jackets they had
brought from their native villages, chatted, drank,
quarrelled, or dozed upon the benches or about the floor. One
noisy fellow was singing the Marseillaise at the top of his voice,
another was defying any man in France to beat him at single-stick,
but by far the greater number seemed dispirited and
utterly weary.</p>

<p>A young lad had seated himself at the table, beneath one of
the lamps which, at long distances, lit up the darkness of the
great bare room. Writing materials were before him, and he
had begun a letter, but paused, as if unable to proceed, and
shaded his face with his hand. Presently the tears dropped
slowly down between his fingers, blistering the paper; then
once more he seized the pen, and wrote eagerly and <span class="locked">rapidly:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Dearest mother, forgive me. I could not&mdash;no, I could not
expose you and Clémence to the terrible sufferings inflicted upon
the families of the refractory, even if, for myself, I was strong
enough to encounter the horrors of a convict prison. There
was no way but the way I took. M. le Curé answered for me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
to the maire, and concealed me in his house until marching
orders came. As we started in the gray dawn of a winter’s
morning, I hoped to pass unnoticed; but so many villagers
were there to bid farewell to their friends, that I know you
must have heard all. Mother, Clémence, pray for me; and
oh, mother, forgive me if you can! It is not for Napoleon I
am going to fight, but for France.”</p>

<p>“Conscript, do you want that letter put into the post to-night?”
asked a short, thick-set, red-haired man with a corporal’s
badge on his sleeve; “because, if you do, I am going
out, and I am a very obliging fellow.”</p>

<p>Henri looked up quickly. He might perhaps have doubted
the corporal’s word, but five or six other letters which he held
in his hand seemed to corroborate his statement; besides, he
knew that for him there would be no leave to go out that
night.</p>

<p>“Then I shall be very much obliged to you, corporal,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Quick with you then. Sign your name and give it to me.
I cannot wait all night. You may make my compliments to
your sweetheart while you are about it, however.”</p>

<p>Henri hastily folded and sealed his letter, and put it in the
corporal’s outstretched hand.</p>

<p>“Peste, man!” said the other impatiently; “where is the
postage?”</p>

<p>Henri took out half a franc. “That is it, I think,” he said,
without noticing the signs one of his comrades was making to
attract his attention. The corporal flung the coin upon the
table, and caught it again, as if to try whether it was genuine,
muttered a curse, and went his way.</p>

<p>“Fool!” said Henri’s neighbour. “Did you not see he
wanted something to drink? What else should he take your
letter for? Look out for yourself on parade to-morrow; he
will do you a mischief if he can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
“And who cares?” cried the chanter of the Marseillaise.
“We want no aristocrats among us. ‘Çà ira! çà ira!’”</p>

<p>“We want no bad companions either,” said Féron, who was
standing near, “so you may keep your breath for your eternal
‘Çà ira,’ Guillaume St. Luc.” Then, going over to Henri, he
sat down beside him, and laying his hand on his shoulder, said
in a low voice, “Keep up your heart, M. de Talmont. Who
knows but you have a marshal’s bâton in your knapsack?”</p>

<p>Henri felt grateful for the kind words, and perhaps yet more
so for the form of address, which had not fallen upon his ear
since the miserable morning when he marched out of Brie&mdash;a
conscript. He placed his white, delicate hand in the rough
palm of the blacksmith’s son. “You are a good comrade,” he
said.</p>

<p>“I vowed you should find me that, the day Mademoiselle
Clémence spoke to me so kindly,” returned Féron.</p>

<p>“But as to the marshal’s bâton,” resumed Henri, “that is a
fine story. Six feet of Russian clay to lie in is what more of
us are likely to get, I fancy.”</p>

<p>“No good comes of burying ourselves before we are dead,”
returned the cheery Féron. “Of course, some are killed in
every war. It is their luck. If a Russian bullet has my name
upon it, why, then, I shall have the consolation of falling in
the greatest war of the greatest captain that ever lived. I
shall see his eagles flap their wings over Moscow and St. Petersburg.
I shall die in the hour of victory, and I shall die shouting,
‘Vive l’Empereur!’” In fact, the last words so nearly
approached a shout already, that they were taken up and re-echoed
by those around.</p>

<p>Then Féron resumed his low tone. “M. de Talmont, may I
give you a word of advice?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, comrade.”</p>

<p>“When you hear other people shouting, always shout
too; and the greater fools you think them, the louder you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
ought to shout, if only by way of drowning their foolish
voices.”</p>

<p>For the first time since the day of the conscription Henri
laughed; and Féron presently continued, “But as for me, I do
not shout ‘Vive l’Empereur!’ like a fool. I know very well
what I am about. I am only a conscript, it is true, but I am
a soldier. The whole world is before me, and if I am brave,
active, and resolute, the marshal’s bâton is no impossible dream
for me. If we had lived in the old times, M. de Talmont, you
would have ridden a fine horse and worn a beautiful sword;
and I should have been like the dust beneath your feet&mdash;a
private all my days, and no more. Thanks to the Revolution
and the Empire, we have changed all that; so now we can be
good comrades, as you have been kind enough to say.”</p>

<p>Good comrades they were through many a dreary day of
drill and marching. At first the physical hardships of his life
weighed so heavily upon Henri that thought and feeling were
almost crushed into silence. When he halted for the night,
after a long day’s march, he was scarcely conscious of anything
except weary limbs and blistered feet. During his stay at the
depôt in Metz, where the conscripts had to go through some
preliminary training, things were scarcely better. The moral
and the mental atmosphere of the barrack-room were alike
abhorrent to his refined, sensitive nature; while the cruel and
degrading punishments that followed any failure in skill or
quickness on the parade-ground, forced him to bend all his remaining
energies to the task of avoiding them. No answer to
his letter from Paris ever reached him, and this added to the
dull apathy that was creeping over his soul. His mother, he
feared, was implacable. And Clémence?&mdash;perhaps his mother
would not allow her to write, perhaps she herself was too
deeply offended to make the attempt.</p>

<p>At last marching orders came once more. Strange to say,
from that day the heavy cloud of gloom that hung over Henri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
began to lighten. Change of scene proved a tonic, and as he
grew accustomed to long marches he ceased to suffer so greatly
from fatigue. Like other young conscripts who did not droop
and fail utterly, he gradually plucked up strength and spirits.
As he was uniformly gentle and courteous&mdash;no ordinary merit
in a French soldier of the Empire&mdash;he often met with much
kindness from the families upon whom he was billeted; and
the extreme youthfulness of his appearance gained many friends
for him. By the time he reached the headquarters of the
imperial army, the profession into which he had been forced
was rather an object of indifference than of detestation to
him. When the recruits were reviewed by Napoleon in person,
he remembered the sage advice of Féron, and did not
imagine that a cry of “Vive l’Empereur!” from the lips of
a De Talmont would awaken the slumbering dust of his ancestors.
Moreover, he could not but gaze, with a kind of
fascination that had in it as much of admiration as of horror,
upon the face of the man whose will at that moment was
the most stupendous force in all the world. Henri de Talmont
did not love Napoleon Buonaparte&mdash;he feared him,
perhaps he hated him&mdash;but, like almost every other man in
Europe, he believed him irresistible. There was a sense of
exhilaration in the universal feeling that to march under him
was infallibly to march to victory. Some faint reflected glow
from the enthusiasm of all around could not fail to reach him
and to awaken stirrings of the martial ardour that slumbered
in the son of a long line of gallant warriors.</p>

<p>An unknown unit in a regiment of infantry&mdash;young recruits
who as yet had won no laurels&mdash;Henri de Talmont marched
one day over a temporary wooden bridge which had been flung
by French pontoniers across the Niemen. “Now, mes enfants,”
their captain said, “you are standing upon Russian ground.”</p>

<p>They cheered, embraced one another, and shouted until they
were hoarse, “Vive l’Empereur! vive Napoleon! A bas les<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Russes!” Henri shouted as loudly as the rest; while, at least
to the human eye, coming events cast no shadow before, nor
was there any foreboding voice raised to whisper, as that vast
and gallant host passed <span class="locked">by,&mdash;</span></p>

<span class="smcap1 a">A great</span> battle, and a great victory&mdash;this was what
Henri de Talmont, in common with the six hundred
thousand fighting men who crossed the Niemen
under Napoleon, fully expected to see. Young
hearts kindled, young blood grew hot at the thought; while
the veterans of Lodi, of Austerlitz, of Jena, saw their cherished
laurels fade and pale before the lustre of those with which they
hoped soon to adorn their victorious brows. And then how
royally would the treasures of Moscow and St. Petersburg
recompense all their toils!</p>

<p>But there was no great battle. The Russians, under Barclay
de Tolly, retreated without fighting, skilfully drawing the
enemy after them into the immense and dreary plains of the
interior. Then followed a succession of marches, as wearisome
and far more monotonous than those by which the recruits
had reached the headquarters of their army. The weather was
hot and sultry&mdash;a curious first experience of the climate of
Russia&mdash;and both men and horses suffered from the want of
water. Other wants, too, were supplied but carelessly, or
perhaps not at all. Many a conscript lay down supperless
night after night beside the fire of his bivouac, to sleep away
his hunger as best he could. It is said that some even died of
starvation, while others found unwholesome nutriment in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
unripe corn and the raw vegetables that grew along their route.
Nor did the knowledge that the general of his division was
feasting upon sterlet and champagne make the hard, insufficient
fare of the conscript more palatable. “It is the soldier’s own
fault if he wants anything in an enemy’s country,” was a maxim
often repeated; but what can the soldier do when the people
flee at his approach, carrying off or destroying everything they
possess, and the country, at best but thinly inhabited, is left a
desert around him?<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> Yet it must be owned that the French
had themselves to thank for some of their privations, since
those peasants who did not flee at their approach were plundered,
beaten, ill-treated, perhaps even murdered.</p>

<p>One day Henri accompanied a detachment of his regiment
which was sent out on a foraging expedition. They were under
the command of Seppel, the corporal who had undertaken to
post Henri’s letter in Paris; but he was a sergeant now, and
rode a good horse, while the others tramped wearily on foot.
After a long march through a dreary country they saw, towards
evening, a brown village surrounded by promising corn-fields.
“Courage, mes enfants,” cried Seppel; “here is luck for us at
last. No doubt food and water, ay, and brandy too, are to be
found yonder.”</p>

<p>They marched across the fields, trampling down the standing
corn without remorse. Henri and some of his comrades were
hungry enough to pluck the unripe ears and to eat them as
they passed, like another company strangely opposite to these
in their character and their place in the world’s history.</p>

<p>As they approached the village, they became aware that its
inhabitants had not only seen them, but were prepared for their
approach. A crowd of men and boys, armed with axes, pitchforks,
and reaping-hooks, came towards them with loud cries
and intentions evidently the most hostile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Seppel caught hold of a tall, gaunt soldier, whose white
uniform gleamed conspicuous amongst the blue tunics of the
rest, and pushed him to the front. “Here, Klinki, Schlinki,
or whatever your unpronounceable name may be, tell these
beggars in their own jargon that we want food for man and
horse, and that if they give it, in plenty and at once, we will
do them no harm.”</p>

<p>The Pole&mdash;who had been brought with the party to act as
interpreter, as he happened to know a little Russian&mdash;tried to
gain a hearing; but in vain. So the Frenchmen drew their
swords, and a brisk fight began. Suddenly, however, Seppel
observed something which made him call upon his men to stop.
He saw a party leaving the village and proceeding towards the
adjoining birch-wood, and he rightly conjectured that these
were the women and children under the escort of some of the
men who had remained behind for the purpose. In fact, this
had been from the first the design of the villagers, and the
attack had been only a feint made in order to gain time for its
execution. Seppel raised his hand, pointing to the retreating
group. “Fire, mes enfants!” he cried; “fire yonder&mdash;upon
them!” They were just within musket-range, and the sharp,
ringing sound of the shots was followed by heart-rending cries.</p>

<p>There was no more thought of resistance. The village lads
threw down their extemporized weapons, and hurried to the
assistance of their friends. Soon the whole party, their movements
quickened by terror, had disappeared into the wood,
carrying with them their wounded, perhaps their dead. “Was
not that well done?” laughed Seppel. “I knew they would
go to look after the women at the first cry.”</p>

<p>Thus Nicolofsky was taken by the French. The victors were
soon busy exploring the deserted cottages in search of food
and vodka. Other things too were needed.</p>

<p>“Here, blacksmith,” said Seppel to Féron, “look after my
horse. He has cast a shoe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
“Yes, sergeant,” returned Féron coolly, “if you will find
me a hammer and tongs, and a nail or two.”</p>

<p>“Is that my business, stupid? Go and look. These fellows
have horses, so they must have smith’s tackle somewhere
about.”</p>

<p>“And they call this conquering a country!” grumbled
Féron as he walked away. “Well, it may be glorious, but it
is not particularly convenient or amusing.”</p>

<p>At that moment there was a joyful shout from some of the
party. Very few fires were burning in the village on that
warm summer evening, but in one of the two largest cottages
the great stove had been lighted, and a capacious caldron of
tschi was simmering over it. The French soldiers fully appreciated
the national dish of the Russians, and found the prospect
of an abundant and savoury supper very agreeable.</p>

<p>“Here is one good thing for me,” said Féron, glancing at the
fire. “Now for hammer and nails.&mdash;Talmont, you lazy fellow,
don’t stand there gazing at nothing, but come and help me to
find them.”</p>

<p>But when they stood outside together, Féron’s tone changed.
“M. Henri,” he said in a quick, eager whisper, “show me your
musket.”</p>

<p>Henri did so with a smile.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Féron, looking relieved, “then after all you
<em>did</em> fire. I feared you would not, and I was going to give you
a word of advice.”</p>

<p>“I <em>did</em> fire,” answered Henri in a low voice,&mdash;“in the air.
What <em>else</em> could I do, Féron? they were women and children.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps <em>I</em> did not shoot very straight either; still we
are in an enemy’s country. Why did not the Czar do whatever
the Emperor wanted him? But take care, M. Henri; that old
fox Seppel is no friend of yours.”</p>

<p>They entered another cottage in search of what they wanted,
and Féron struck his foot against a small bucket full of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
liquid. “Ha! what have we here? Vodka, I hope.” He
stooped down and tasted it, but got up with an air of disgust.
“No such luck. Only frog’s ratefia” (so the French called
the kvass of the Russians). “How could any poor wretches be
expected to fight with such stuff as that in their insides?”</p>

<p>“Let me have a pull at it,” said Henri. “I am thirsty
enough not to despise even frog’s ratefia. Do you think Seppel
means to stay here all night?”</p>

<p>“He ought not; but if he finds vodka I would not answer
for the consequences. And certainly it is growing very late.”</p>

<p>Féron at last succeeded in finding the tools with which the
villagers performed whatever rude blacksmith’s work they
needed. Then he rejoined his companions, who were just
beginning to help themselves to the supper which had been
prepared for very different guests by the priest’s wife. The
cottage was that of Pope Nikita, and the day happened to be
the name-day of Anna Popovna.</p>

<p>A good store of vodka had been found, and with this help
the soldiers soon forgot their troubles, past, present, and to
come. They ate, drank, and made merry; and the sergeant,
far from being any check upon their mirth, drank more deeply
and talked more boisterously than any of them. The night
closed over them unawares, and of course there was now no
question of leaving their comfortable quarters until the morning.</p>

<p>Féron had brought in his hand a small piece of iron, as well
as the hammer and tongs he had been using. He had a jesting
dispute with one of his comrades, who called in question his
capabilities as a blacksmith. “Blacksmith, indeed!” said
Féron. “That’s nothing. I am quite an artist, messieurs. At
Brie I was accounted a connoisseur&mdash;an ornamental worker in
brass, iron, and the other precious metals.”</p>

<p>“A fine story,” laughed Henri, who was greatly the better
for his comfortable meal. “At Brie your crooked nails were a
joke for the whole village.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
“Don’t talk, but let us <em>see</em> what you can do. Give us a
specimen,” said a conscript, a timorous little fellow, who was
unpopular in the regiment because of his habit of shifting off
his work upon his comrades.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will,” returned Féron. “I’ll make an iron to brand
you with when you are caught trying to desert, as you are sure
to be one of these days.”</p>

<p>A general laugh followed this retort, then silence fell over
the group, while Féron hammered away at his task, and most
of the others began to doze in their places. When at last he
held up triumphantly, in proof of his skill, a finely-formed
branding-iron with the letter N upon it, his companions were
far too sleepy to give him the applause he expected.</p>

<p>One hour&mdash;two hours passed away. All were sleeping now,
even the sentinels Seppel had placed outside as a matter of
form. The village of Nicolofsky was as still as it was wont to
be in the noon of a midsummer night. If a sound of weeping and
lamentation came, softened by distance, from the adjacent birch-wood,
it failed to disturb the sleepers. But the short summer
night was soon over, and the dawn began to creep in, cold and gray.</p>

<p>Its first faint light fell upon the figure of a mujik, who
traversed, with stealthy, silent footsteps, the deserted street of
his native village. As he passed the church he noticed that
the door had been forced open&mdash;though it was again roughly
secured on the outside. He removed the fastening and looked
in. The spirit of wanton outrage, only too common amongst
the French soldiery, had made Seppel choose that sacred place
as a stable for his horse, and the animal was eating corn out of
a consecrated vessel placed upon the altar.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> Michael Ivanovitch
ground his teeth, and his dark cheek flushed ominously; but
he passed on, for his heart was full of a great, deep anguish,
before which every other emotion paled and faded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
That which, at the risk of his life, he had come to fetch, was
not in the desecrated church. It had to be sought for in
the very place where most of the French soldiers had taken up
their quarters for the night&mdash;the cottage of Pope Nikita. The
door of the cottage was half open, and he saw that the floor
was covered with sleeping forms clad in the blue tunic of the
French infantry. What matter to him? Blotting out that
sight, he saw the wistful, longing look in the dying eyes of the
girl he loved, and, before him, the sacred picture her faltering
accents had entreated him to bring to her. Thank God, there
it hung yet&mdash;on the cottage wall, in the right-hand corner.
Could he tread amongst those sleepers without awakening them,
and reach it?</p>

<p>His step was noiseless as the footfall of the desert panther,
and the French were weary with marching, and most of them
heavy with vodka. He had grasped his prize&mdash;he stood with
his hand on its frame, and a momentary throb of triumph in
his sorrowful heart, when suddenly a head was raised; some
one more wakeful than the rest had seen the intruder. In
an instant the alarm was given, and the whole group were
on their feet; in another, a dozen strong hands were laid at
once upon Michael Ivanovitch.</p>

<p>He struggled desperately, but what could one man do against
a dozen armed with swords and bayonets? He would have
been cut down almost immediately, had not Seppel, very
sensibly, called upon his men to spare his life and secure him
as a prisoner. “He may serve for a guide, or at least give us
some information,” he said. Then he summoned the Pole to
act as interpreter, taking the precaution to make another man&mdash;Féron
it happened to be&mdash;stand before the prisoner with his
loaded musket pointed at his breast. “He looks dangerous,”
he observed.</p>

<p>There was not much to be read in Michael’s stolid, determined
face, as the light of the early morning shone upon it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
He had placed the sacred picture in the breast of his caftan;
but seeing the musket, he took it out and laid it on the table.
“They shall not harm <em>that</em>, at all events,” he thought.</p>

<p>“Tell him,” said Seppel to the Pole, “that if he fails to
satisfy us, we will shoot him; but that if he behaves well, we
will spare his life.”</p>

<p>The Pole interpreted, and Michael answered coolly, “Nitshevo.”</p>

<p>“That means,” the Pole explained, “‘It is no matter. I do
not care.’”</p>

<p>“Ask him,” pursued Seppel, “what brought him here.”</p>

<p>Michael, as soon as he understood the question, pointed to
the picture.</p>

<p>Seppel laughed incredulously; and the Pole inquired of his
own accord, “Is that the whole truth, Russian?”</p>

<p>“Da,” returned the prisoner.</p>

<p>“He says, ‘Yes,’” the Pole explained.</p>

<p>“Tell him he is a liar,” said Seppel.</p>

<p>A scornful smile was the only answer, and Seppel tried
another course. “Ask him,” he said, “how far it is from this
place to Klopti.”</p>

<p>He did so; but Michael answered nothing.</p>

<p>“Tell him he must take us there to-day.”</p>

<p>Still no answer.</p>

<p>“Tell him if he chooses to behave in this way he has not
two minutes to live.”</p>

<p>“Nitshevo,” was the only reply.</p>

<p>This went on for some minutes, every inquiry being met by
a dogged silence, every threat by “Nitshevo.” At last Seppel
lost patience, and told Féron to fire upon the prisoner.</p>

<p>But Féron disliked the task, for he rather admired the courage
of the Russian. He slowly laid his finger on the trigger of
his musket, then withdrew it again. This he did twice, keenly
watching the countenance of the prisoner, which showed no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
perceptible change. All the French soldiers had now crowded
around them, and were watching the scene with interested faces.</p>

<p>“Do not kill him, sergeant,” pleaded one.</p>

<p>“He is a brave fellow. Try something else first,” said
another.</p>

<p>Seppel paused, and a new thought occurred to him. “Ah,
yes,” he said, “these Russian slaves understand nothing except
it comes to them through their bodily feelings. They are accustomed,
I suppose, to be treated like beasts of the field.&mdash;Pole,
tell him he is our prisoner; <em>that</em>, at least, we will make him
know.&mdash;Féron, put down your musket, and bring that branding-iron
I saw you make last night; there is enough fire yet in the
stove to heat it red-hot.”</p>

<p>Féron obeyed without hesitation, even with alacrity; for it
seemed to him much better to brand a man on the hand than
to shoot him through the heart. So the letter N, fashioned in
sport the night before, was used in earnest now. It came
down with burning pain, and left its mark, indelible for ever,
upon the unresisting hand of Michael.</p>

<p>For a moment his strong frame quivered, but his lips were
silent, pressed closely together. Then he turned to the Pole,
and, for the first time speaking of his own accord, he asked
him, “What does that mean?”</p>

<p>“It means that you belong now, soul and body, to our
Emperor, the great Napoleon. That which you bear on your
hand is his mark&mdash;the first letter of his name.”</p>

<p>Michael smiled slightly, and advancing to the table, laid the
wounded hand upon it. (Féron not unintentionally had made
choice of the left one.) Then with one blow from the axe
which he drew from the sash of his caftan, he severed it from
his wrist. “Take what belongs to your Emperor,” he said,
turning proudly to the astonished group. “As for me, I belong
altogether to the Czar.”<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
A thrill of involuntary admiration passed through the spectators,
and for some moments no one spoke. Meanwhile, in
the calm summer sky outside, the sun was rising, and its first
red beams flashed through the little window upon the homely
features of the serf, which shone with a courage and devotion
that were almost sublime.</p>

<p>“Cut him down!” cried a solitary voice, that of the conscript
who, the night before, had challenged Féron’s skill. But
half-a-dozen other voices cried, “Shame!” while Seppel himself
seemed to hesitate, and stood with the air of a man perplexed
and confounded.</p>

<p>In the meantime Henri de Talmont, who had hitherto taken
no part in the scene, walked boldly up to the prisoner. He
held in his hand a fine white cambric handkerchief, which
he wound carefully about the wounded arm. “As you love
your Czar,” he said gently, “so we Royalists in France loved
our King.”</p>

<p>The words, of course, fell meaningless upon the ear of Michael;
but the tones in which they were uttered, and the action which
accompanied them, were abundantly intelligible. The eyes of
the Russian serf and the French gentleman met with a look of
comprehension and sympathy.</p>

<p>“Shall we let him go?” Seppel asked at length. “What
say you, mes enfants?”</p>

<p>There was now not one dissentient voice, and Seppel turned
to the interpreter. “Tell him, Pole, that we Frenchmen know
how to respect a brave enemy. He is free.”</p>

<p>Michael heard, bowed his head gravely in acknowledgment,
took up the sacred picture with his remaining hand, and walked
slowly out. He scarcely noticed the ringing cheer which the
excitable Frenchmen sent after him. Their applause was nothing
to him: it could not bring back the young life of his
betrothed, flowing forth so quickly through the wound their
guns had made last night. Enough if he might but be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
time to see her once again, and to comfort her dying moments
with the treasure he had risked so much to procure.</p>

<p>When he was gone, Seppel stretched his limbs once more
before the stove, and said half to himself with a meditative air,
“After all, I begin to doubt whether we shall succeed so easily
in conquering these Russians.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap-image">
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_i.jpg" width="73" height="72" alt="" />
<span class="smcap1 i">It</span> was evening. Ivan Pojarsky sat alone in the
saloon of the Wertsch family mansion. The costly
furniture with which it was strewn had that indescribable
air of neglect and forlornness which household
goods assume when death, or sorrow deep as death, broods
over their owners. There was disorder too: chairs had been
dragged carelessly about, and their rich and delicate coverings
soiled and crumpled; while a beautiful climbing plant, laden
with rare flowers, lay unheeded on the floor beside the broken
shaft that had been its support. A costly buhl table near
Ivan’s chair had the remains of his last meal upon it.</p>

<p>Within the apartment all was still,&mdash;Ivan sat motionless and
silent, his head resting on his hands,&mdash;but without there was a
hoarse, continuous, never-ending murmur, made up of many
sounds. There was the tramp of armed men, heavy and monotonous.
There was the roll and rumble of ten thousand wheels&mdash;wheels
of every sort and description, from those of the ponderous
waggon laden with the goods of an entire household to
those of the light telega, from which every now and then a
scout was imparting to the breathless crowd his tidings that
the standards of Napoleon had been seen at such or such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
point of the Smolensko road. Mingling with and following
the stately rhythmic march of the disciplined hosts was the
tread of innumerable footsteps&mdash;footsteps of women and little
children, of boys and aged men, who were leaving with breaking
hearts the only home they had ever known. And if the
weeping and wailing, the sighs and groans and cries, which
filled the clear September air did not rise above all other sounds,
it was only because the things most deep and real are ofttimes
the last to meet the eye or reach the ear&mdash;except, indeed, the
ever-present eye and the ever-listening ear of Him who notes
“the sob in the dark and the falling of tears.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Ivan raised his head and looked around him. The
last few weeks had changed him wonderfully. He appeared
several years older&mdash;no longer a stripling, but a man, with a
man’s responsibilities, thoughts, and duties. There was in
his young face a look of sternness, as of one who had to do
hard things and to bid others do them; there was the high,
courageous, half-defiant air of one who dares death cheerfully,
even joyfully, and also an expression of proud though mournful
satisfaction. For had not he, a youth scarcely twenty,
been intrusted with a terrible secret, been charged with a desperate
but honourable mission?</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, gospodin,” said a servant, entering. Ivan
was now virtually the master of the household, for both the
Wertsches were with the army&mdash;Adrian serving as a volunteer,
Leon as a lieutenant of hussars. “Here is a mujik,” continued
the servant, “who wishes to speak with your excellency.”</p>

<p>“Send him in,” said Ivan quickly. “And&mdash;stay a moment,
Joseph. What does your wife say of her mistress?”</p>

<p>“The countess, gospodin, will not hear reason from my wife,
though she has been waiting upon her these twenty years,
any more than from your excellency. ‘The French,’ says
my lady, ‘will never enter holy Moscow. They dare not.’
I must own, Lord Ivan, that Maria thinks this very hard;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
because if our lady the countess will not be persuaded to go
away, as all other folk are doing who have brains in their
heads, she&mdash;my wife I mean&mdash;must stay, too, of course, and
be murdered by the Nyemtzi.”</p>

<p>“Murdered by the Nyemtzi shall <em>our</em> women never be,
Joseph,” said Ivan, with a flash in his eyes. “At the worst,
we know what to do. Tell thy wife the countess must be
induced to quit this house before to-morrow night. If she will
not leave the city, like a sensible woman, at least she must go
to the Devitshei Convent, and Maria must go with her. I suppose
even the infidel French will scarcely outrage <em>that</em> asylum.
Meanwhile, send in this mujik; perhaps he brings tidings.”</p>

<p>A tall figure entered, with a bandaged arm, and wearing a
rough, soiled caftan, and heavy Russia leather boots that left
their traces on the inlaid floor.</p>

<p>Ivan looked up, started, hesitated, then exclaimed in great
surprise, “Michael Ivanovitch! One-eared Michael!”</p>

<p>“One-handed Michael now, at your service, Ivan Barrinka;
and well if <em>that</em> were the only loss I had to tell of.”</p>

<p>“Have you come from Nicolofsky?” asked Ivan.</p>

<p>“Yes, I come from Nicolofsky. Barrinka, the Nyemtzi have
been there.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried Ivan. “Curse them!”</p>

<p>“I have done with cursing them, Ivan Barrinka&mdash;I cannot
find words&mdash;so I leave them to God. He knows what wages
they have earned, and he will pay them one day. But as for
me, my heart is hot and dry, and unless I can go and fight and
kill some of them I shall die.”</p>

<p>“What has happened, Michael? what have they done to
you?”</p>

<p>“At Christmas I was to be married to Anna Popovna. You
remember her, Ivan Barrinka?”</p>

<p>“<em>Remember</em> her!” cried Ivan angrily. “Of what are you
dreaming, Michael? Do you not know that I&mdash;I&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
“Oh, I forgot&mdash;it seems a thousand years ago,” said Michael,
in a sad, dreamy voice. “Besides, it was never anything but
child’s play with you. Ivan Barrinka, we quarrelled in the old
days, you and I. She used to like you better than me, because
you were handsome and a boyar. But that is all over now.
We shall quarrel no more, for Anna Popovna is with the
saints. The Nyemtzi have killed her.”</p>

<p>Ivan’s agitation was extreme. He still fancied he loved the
village girl, no real passion having as yet taken possession of
his heart to “put the old cheap joy in the scorned dust.” In
wild excitement he strode up and down the room, uttering
incoherent lamentations and cursing the French; but at last he
stopped before Michael and asked briefly, in a choking voice,
“How?”</p>

<p>Michael’s grief had been his companion for weary days and
nights&mdash;he was used to it now, so he answered very quietly,
“One evening we saw the blue-coats coming, and some of us
went out to show fight and keep them off a little, while the
rest convoyed our women safely into the wood. But the
scoundrels saw them, and fired. The distance was long, and
they did not take good aim. Only two shots told: one of
them wounded the lad we used to call little Peter rather badly
in the shoulder; the other&mdash;killed her&mdash;”</p>

<p>“At once!”</p>

<p>“She lived some hours. She did not suffer much. She
died&mdash;in peace.” Michael spoke with difficulty, and in a low
voice. There was a pause; then he resumed, taking a picture
from beneath his caftan and showing it to Ivan, “Her
last look was fixed on this. Her father gave it to me, because
I brought it to her from his house, where the Nyemtzi
were.”</p>

<p>“Did the French stay there for the night?”</p>

<p>Michael nodded.</p>

<p>“Then what were you about, Michael Ivanovitch,” cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Ivan with sudden energy&mdash;“what were you about that you
did not set the village on fire and burn it over their heads?”</p>

<p>Michael’s remaining hand fell by his side with a gesture of
mingled admiration and regret. “Great St. Nicholas!” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Ivan.</p>

<p>“We never thought of it,” cried Michael. “Would to God
we had! What a sight it would have been!”</p>

<p>“You may yet see a greater, Michael Ivanovitch.”</p>

<p>There was silence, and the tumult outside became audible
once more to both.</p>

<p>At last Michael resumed. “I am forgetting what I came
for. Since that night my head is confused. I live those last
hours over and over again. I hear nothing, I see nothing
except that bed of leaves in the forest, and the torches flickering
upon those sad faces all around, and that one sweet white
face&mdash;except when I sleep and dream of killing Frenchmen.
Ay, killing Frenchmen, that is it! Ivan Barrinka, I come here
to beg of you&mdash;if you like it, on my bended knees&mdash;to speak one
word for me to our lord the Czar,&mdash;only one word.”</p>

<p>“My good friend&mdash;for my friend you are, in the love we
both have for the dead&mdash;I would speak a hundred if I could;
but the Czar is in St. Petersburg, and I am here. I scarce
hope ever to see again the face that is to us all as the sun in
the heavens.”</p>

<p>“Then give me a written word for him. You are a boyar,
and can do it.”</p>

<p>“Nay, I should not presume so far. He does not even know
of my existence&mdash;<em>yet</em>.” The last word was spoken proudly,
with an evident under-current of meaning. “But what is it
you want, Michael?”</p>

<p>“See, I have lost my left hand.”</p>

<p>“Another French outrage?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and no. When I went to fetch that picture, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
caught me, and put their Emperor’s mark on my hand. Was
I to carry <em>that</em> with me all my life, and after my life in the
resurrection, before the judgment-seat of God? I had a good
hand still, and a good axe in it, and with these I struck off
what they had defiled. Now there is not an inch of me that
does not belong to the Czar.”</p>

<p>“Nobly done, brother!” cried Ivan, embracing him. “I am
proud of my old Nicolofsky playfellow. Michael, will you cast
in your lot with me, and let us serve the Czar together?”</p>

<p>“Ay, Barrinka; but there is the difficulty. No use in <em>my</em>
offering myself for a recruit. No officer would take me, because
I want my hand. That is why I pray you to ask the Czar to
let me fight for him in spite of that loss. You could tell him I
would serve him so faithfully.”</p>

<p>“I can show you, even now, a way to render him signal and
splendid service; but it is hazardous, <em>very</em>. It is scarce likely
we shall live to go through with it; but, Michael, if we do, I
think the Czar will have cause to thank us.”</p>

<p>“And shall we kill plenty of Nyemtzi?” Michael asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>“We shall deal their Emperor a blow he will never forget.”
Ivan sat down before him, looked at him in silence for some moments,
and then, apparently changing the subject, he asked, “Are
you not surprised at the condition in which you find the city?”</p>

<p>“What condition?&mdash;Oh yes; I saw crowds of people going
away.” Then, looking up&mdash;“But is it true, is it <em>really</em> true,
Barrinka, that holy Moscow is to be given up to the infidel
Nyemtzi?”</p>

<p>“Too true. A great battle was fought a few days ago at
Borodino. The French say they won, and we say we won;
but, however that may be, the result is for us as bad as a
defeat. Marshal Kutusov says it is now hopeless to think
of defending the city. All day our soldiers, with breaking
hearts, have been marching through on their way to Vladimir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
“And without fighting? Ivan Barrinka, it is too bad! So
those accursed Nyemtzi will have it all&mdash;the glorious, beautiful
city of the Czar; the tombs, the treasures of his fathers; the
forty times forty churches, the holy pictures of the saints!
Woe, woe! Why have we lived to see such days?”</p>

<p>“Listen, Michael,” said Ivan, arresting the hand with which
he was tearing his beard. “Listen to me. The Nyemtzi shall
<em>not</em> have it.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Barrinka?”</p>

<p>“This. We will do for holy Moscow&mdash;our beautiful, our
beloved&mdash;what a father would do for an only daughter, a husband
for a wife, a brother for a sister, if there were no other
way to save them from those accursed Nyemtzi&mdash;our own hands
will deal the death-blow.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“What should <em>you</em> have done with Nicolofsky while the
French were in it?”</p>

<p>“Holy saints! Then you mean to burn the city?”</p>

<p>“These hands of mine will fling the brand into this house,
which has been my home ever since I left your village. Nay,
more, I am one of the directors of the secret band commissioned
to spread the conflagration.”</p>

<p>Michael stared at him in amazement, but did not speak.</p>

<p>Ivan resumed: “Perhaps you will think me dreaming&mdash;at
least you will wonder by what authority I tell you these strange
and awful things. I was a boy when last we met, Michael;
indeed, until six weeks ago I was little more. Then the war
broke out, and the Czar came here. I saw him; not for the
first time, Michael Ivanovitch, for it was he&mdash;he and no other&mdash;whom
I saw in my childhood’s days ministering to poor unconscious
Stefen on the bank of the Oka. My heart went
forth to him at once, laid itself at his feet, vowed to serve him
until death.”</p>

<p>“So? Then <em>you</em> fight for love, Ivan Barrinka. <em>I</em> fight for hate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
“I too, after what you have told me to-night,” said Ivan,
with flashing eyes. He continued more calmly: “Then I went
to the governor, Count Rostopchine, and told him my story.
I said that, though my name was of the noblest, I had not,
like other boyars, lands, or serfs, or gold to give to the Czar;
I had only a strong heart, full of devotion. He answered me,
for he saw I was in earnest, ‘Such hearts are what we want
now.’ Then he told me what to do. At first, Michael, I was
horror-stricken. I had rather have been burned at the stake
myself. But he assures me there is no other way of saving holy
Russia and the Czar. Moreover, most of the nobles, and all
the merchants except seven, have resolved upon the sacrifice of
their property. Loss of life we will try to prevent.”</p>

<p>“I suppose all good Russians, save those who, like you,
have work to do, are leaving the city?”</p>

<p>“Almost all; except the ‘black people,’ who think they have
nothing to lose and perhaps something to gain by the confusion.
A few others are remaining on various pretexts; for instance,
Countess Wertsch, the owner of this house, obstinately insists
upon staying, positively refusing to believe that the French
will enter the city&mdash;a great embarrassment to me, since I
cannot burn the house over her head. I must get her away
somehow. For this and other matters I need advice from my
good old friend Petrovitch, and I mean to go to him at daybreak.
You shall come with me; I should like to tell him
what you have done, Michael.”</p>

<p>“Anywhere with you. There will be plenty of work for us,
and plenty of danger too. All the better for me. But you
will be sorry to part with life, Ivan Barrinka.”</p>

<p>For a moment Ivan’s face assumed a grave and thoughtful
expression; then it gradually lighted up, until it absolutely
glowed with enthusiasm. “If I fall,” he said, “Count Rostopchine
has promised to name me to the Czar.”</p>

<span class="smcap1 t">The</span> two young men wore out the short summer
night in earnest talk. Neither thought of sleep;
but Ivan was careful to provide a comfortable
repast for Michael, and was by no means reluctant
to share it. Very early in the morning they set out on foot
for the merchants’ quarter. The shades of night had brought
no repose to the doomed city; hour after hour the living tide
flowed on without pause or respite, and Ivan and Michael found
it extremely difficult to thread their way through the dense confused
mass of vehicles and foot passengers that crowded every
street.</p>

<p>At last they reached the dwelling of Petrovitch. The doors
were all open. Unhindered and unannounced, they walked
into the great hall. Here they found the whole family assembled.
In the midst sat the patriarch, with silver hair and beard,
and large, wide-open, sightless eyes. His face was as calm and
almost as colourless as that of the dead; but its look expressed
the steadfast high resolve of a “living soul,” the heir of a deathless
immortality.</p>

<p>All around that calm centre there was profound agitation.
Women were weeping and wringing their hands; and those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
“tears of bearded men” which are so rare and sad to see were
flowing without restraint. One of the sons of Petrovitch&mdash;in the
green uniform of a Russian grenadier, his military hat, with
its long black feather tipped with white, laid beside him&mdash;was
sobbing bitterly himself, while he tried to comfort a little girl
whom he held in his arms. Another young soldier, almost a
boy, seemed to be imploring the interference of his mother, who
was sitting a little apart, her face covered with a kerchief. At
one side of the old man’s chair stood his eldest son, with a look
of indignant appeal and remonstrance; at the other knelt
Feodor&mdash;and <em>his</em> face no one saw.</p>

<p>“Welcome, Prince Ivan!” cried Ivan Petrovitch as soon as
he perceived his entrance. “Come hither and speak to our
father. It may be he will listen to you, as the son of his ancient
lord.”</p>

<p>“Is that Prince Ivan?” asked the old man. “Son of my
dear lord, ever welcome in this house, yet give us leave, I pray
you, for a little space, for this is a bitter hour to me and to all
of us. I am bidding farewell to every one in whose veins my
blood is flowing. By-and-by I will talk once more with thee.”</p>

<p>Ivan would have withdrawn, from a feeling that the scene
was too sacred for any not immediately belonging to the family;
but the eldest son of Petrovitch appealed to him once more.
“Have you not a word&mdash;you whom he loved so dearly&mdash;to persuade
him against flinging his life away?”</p>

<p>“My son, I am not flinging my life away,” the old man
interposed. “That would be a sin. I am only laying it
at the feet of the God who gave it. He has given me a message
for these Nyemtzi, and shall I spare to deliver it?”</p>

<p>“But how is this, dädushka?” asked Ivan gently, as he
drew nearer to the weeping group. “How is this? Do you
not go, with these your beloved ones, to a place of safety?”</p>

<p>“I go indeed to a place of safety, but not with these. My
resolve has long been made; nor is it for thee, Prince Ivan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
nor for you, sons and grandsons, true and well-beloved though
you are, to change it now. Here have I lived, and here will
I die. The Nyemtzi shall enter holy Moscow only over my
body.”<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>“A vain sacrifice, useless as it is cruel,” said Ivan Petrovitch
in a broken voice.</p>

<p>“My son, it is neither. I have no strong arm to fight for
the Czar, but I have yet a voice with which to hurl defiance
against his enemies. It is the mightiest of all voices, though it
makes no sound&mdash;the voice of blood. My blood shall cry to
the invader from the gate of the city I have loved: ‘It is but
vain the labour that you take to conquer this land for your
Prince. A land where youth and manhood arm to resist you,
while old age dies beneath your feet rather than submit to your
sway&mdash;such a land is unconquerable.’ Therefore, my children,
no more words. They are but needless pain, and time presses.
I think my soldier lads should even now be rejoining their
regiments. Are you all here, my brave boys whom I have
given to the Czar?”</p>

<p>The sergeant of grenadiers answered for the rest, “Yes, my
father, all.”</p>

<p>“Four sons and nine sons’ sons&mdash;thirteen in all&mdash;have I
given to our lord. Soldiers of holy Russia, fight bravely; and
may God prosper your arms and give you the victory! I doubt
not he will, for your cause is just.”</p>

<p>“My father, ere we go,” said the sergeant, advancing and
kneeling before him, “bless thy sons.”</p>

<p>In a voice tremulous with deep feeling the solemn patriarchal
blessing was given. One after another the members of
the family advanced to receive it: first the soldier sons and
grandsons, keeping down their emotion with manly self-control;
then Ivan Petrovitch, and a few others whose circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
had prevented their volunteering with the rest; lastly the
women and children. But Feodor did not stir from his place,
until at length the old man called him by name. Then he
slowly rose and stood before him.</p>

<p>“Son Ivan,” said Petrovitch, “come hither and take this
boy’s hand in thine. Children, you know that little Feodor is
all God has left with me of Maria Petrovna, the daughter of
my old age, the one white dove in our falcon’s nest. Be tender
with him, all of you; and thou, Ivan, take care of the lad, and
be to him a father in my place.&mdash;Feodor, my little Feodor,
Maria’s son, God bless thee!”</p>

<p>“Kneel, boy,” whispered Ivan Petrovitch almost angrily, as
Feodor, like one in a trance, stood motionless, with his passive
hand in his uncle’s.</p>

<p>The boy obeyed mechanically. The aged eyes of Petrovitch
were full of unaccustomed tears, and his voice faltered, grew
almost inaudible, as he murmured the words of blessing over
that beloved head. But Feodor showed no sign of feeling,
except that cheek and lip were white as marble.</p>

<p>Ivan Pojarsky, who, though he had withdrawn into the background,
had not left the place, observed him with sorrowful
wonder. “The boy,” he thought, “will soon forget the old
man, who will die with a prayer for him upon his lips.”</p>

<p>Once more the aged voice was heard. Petrovitch arose
slowly from his seat, and lifted up his hands over the group.
“Now farewell, my children, and God bless you. May he
grant us in his mercy a joyful meeting in the home above, the
abode of the righteous, where no enemy or evil thing can enter.
Go in peace.”</p>

<p>Sadly and slowly, one by one, they turned away. Ivan
Pojarsky followed, to assure his weeping friends that he at
least would do all he could for the comfort and protection of
their father. There were servants, too, who purposed remaining
in the house for the present; and to these was intrusted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
task of consummating the sacrifice by setting fire to what had
been the happy home of three generations.</p>

<p>With a feeling akin to awe Ivan returned to the side of
the now solitary old man. He was almost ashamed to bring
his personal difficulties and perplexities before him. A reverent,
tender compassion for the silver hairs so soon to be steeped
in blood filled his heart, though even this was dominated and
subdued by the over-mastering enthusiasm that possessed him,
rising higher and higher every moment. Before that tide of
passionate loyalty and patriotism all else gave way. It seemed
easy and natural&mdash;and oh, how beautiful!&mdash;to die for the Czar
and holy Russia.</p>

<p>Petrovitch, of his own accord, asked him about his plans
and purposes. He knew already what a commission Rostopchine
had intrusted to the young man; and Ivan, though thoroughly
master in outline of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> he had to play, was glad
to consult his aged friend upon certain questions of detail.
After discussing the directions he had to give to the criminals
who were to be released from the various prisons to aid in
the terrible work, he spoke of the unaccountable obstinacy of
the Countess Wertsch, and of the difficulty in which it placed
him.</p>

<p>But instead of expressing indignation at the old woman’s
folly, Petrovitch answered gently, “My boy, be patient with
her. Remember all her days have been spent here. To her,
as to others, the ruin of holy Moscow is like the fall of the sun
from the noonday sky. Should the need to remove her actually
arise, God will show you what to do. But wait. Where we
stand now, hours do the work of years.”</p>

<p>“Dädushka, there is another thought in my mind of which
I want to tell you. I talked it over last night with my old
friend Michael.&mdash;Ah, where is Michael?” said Ivan, who in
the excitement and confusion of the last two hours had totally
forgotten his companion. “No matter,” he continued, “I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
find him by-and-by.&mdash;Say, dädushka, would it not be a pity
these infidel Frenchmen should enter the Kremlin without so
much as a musket-shot to bid them welcome?”</p>

<p>“But what would you do, my son? Remember the lives of
Russians are precious.”</p>

<p>“I should peril no life which would not be just as sorely
perilled elsewhere; but I think that, with the help of the workmen
who are still on the spot, and a few of the lads whom I
know to be ready for any wild work, I could give a fair account
of some of Napoleon’s advanced guard.”</p>

<p>“Well, since Count Rostopchine has left the city, every man
may do that which is right in his own eyes. Have you arms?”</p>

<p>“Plenty; and I, as well as the other directors nominated by
the count, have his authority to distribute them as I see fit.&mdash;Ah,
Pope Yefim, is that you? So you have not left us yet.”</p>

<p>“Not yet, nor ever,” said the priest as he advanced and
saluted first his aged friend, then Ivan.</p>

<p>“I thought all the churchmen were gone already, or going
to-day,” observed Ivan.</p>

<p>“It may be so,” returned Pope Yefim, “but, whosoever goes,
sorrow and death remain.”</p>

<p>“<em>Remain!</em>” cried Ivan. “It is their carnival.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, may not one of God’s humblest ministers remain
also, to pray beside the sorrowful and to bury the dead?”</p>

<p>“My dear pope, the part you have chosen is noble, but most
perilous.”</p>

<p>“I scarcely think so. All civilized nations respect Religion
and her ministers. I have heard that Napoleon said to one of
our popes, who bravely presented himself before him to plead
for his flock, ‘You have done well. Your “Bog” is the same
as our “Dieu.”’”</p>

<p>“Whose altars the French have cast down, and whose worship
they have forsaken; therefore they shall not prosper,” said
Petrovitch. He added after a pause: “My friends, I am solitary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
now. Stay with me for a little while. And if Prince
Ivan will forget his worldly rank in the presence of great
Death, who makes all men equal, I pray you both to partake
with me of what may be to all of us our last meal upon earth.”</p>

<p>Ivan readily consented; and the attendants left in the house,
who watched carefully over their aged master, served a comfortable
repast. One of them informed Ivan that his servant
was in their quarters, awaiting his orders. Michael had been
a deeply-moved spectator of the parting between Petrovitch
and his family. He had been seen coming out of the hall with
a sobbing child in his arms, a little great-grandson of Petrovitch,
whom he was trying to comfort. Afterwards he fraternized
with the attendants, who were mujiks, like himself, and
to whose inquiries he answered simply and briefly that he was
Prince Ivan’s servant.</p>

<p>The hours wore on. At last Ivan and Yefim were obliged
to depart&mdash;Ivan to his work in the city, the priest to one of
the numerous services of his Church.</p>

<p>Then for the first time Petrovitch knew himself indeed alone.
To darkness he was accustomed now, but the strange unwonted
stillness “ached round him like a strong disease and new.”
No kindred voice would break the silence ever again upon
earth. Such had been his deliberate choice, and he must bear
it. But his strong heart sank lower and lower yet, even to
the very depths&mdash;those deepest depths of all, which only strong
hearts know how to sound.</p>

<p>“Out of the depths have I cried unto thee,” said one of old,
uttering the experience of ten thousand tried and sorrowful
hearts. Very earnest was the cry that went up that bitter
hour from the soul of Petrovitch. It was not his first cry to
God; for the hand that had drawn a veil over the eyes of his
body had been gradually and gently opening the eye of his
soul to another and holier light. What though, at the best,
that light was dim and clouded? It was enough for his needs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
and in this hour of lonely anguish it shone out with greater
clearness than ever before. “I am a sinful man,” thought
Feodor Petrovitch; “and now the last hour of my long day of
life has struck. I am going into the presence of God. But
there is the dear Bog Sūn,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> and the cross, of which Pope Yefim
talks. I hope to be forgiven for the sake of what He suffered
there, and to see His face with joy in the resurrection.”</p>

<p>Then thoughts of the past chased each other quickly across
his mind, like clouds across a summer sky. All the events
of his life seemed to crowd upon him, and to pass in review
before him “like a tale that is told.” First came visions of his
early years,&mdash;his village home, his boyhood’s friends, his
dear lord, Prince Pojarsky, with the face of Ivan grown older;
then his own struggles as a man,&mdash;his efforts to secure an
honourable place in the world, to gain wealth, character, and
the esteem of all. But these things flitted lightly by, and did
not stay. What came and stayed, fresh and vivid as though
he saw them even now, were the faces that he loved&mdash;faces
over which the grave had closed long ago. “Yesterday they
seemed so far; to-day they are close at hand. I shall see them
before another sun has set,” he thought. The wife of his youth
came back, young and fair as on her bridal day. Scarce younger
and not less fair, so like that they seemed to mingle into one
sweet all-pervading presence, was that child of his heart, so
tenderly loved, so deeply mourned. As the Hebrew patriarch,
casting a retrospective glance over his long and weary pilgrimage,
rested the wistful gaze of his dying eye upon one chief
unforgotten sorrow&mdash;“<em>As for me</em>, when I came from Padan,
Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan”&mdash;so it was with
Feodor Petrovitch. A passionate yearning swept over him to
see his daughter’s face, to hear her voice again.</p>

<p>By-and-by another change came. It was no longer faces that
haunted him, but voices&mdash;voices and footsteps. The little feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
of his grandchildren pattered around him; he heard their
merry shouts, their ringing laughter at their play. He felt
tempted to call them; he almost believed that if he called they
would come to him. At last he heard the footstep that he
loved best&mdash;so plain, so near, that he thought he must be
dreaming. How strangely fancy must be cheating him! Surely
that <em>was</em> Feodor&mdash;<em>his</em> Feodor&mdash;trying in jest, as he was wont
to do, to steal upon him unawares and surprise him. Surely,
as in the old happy days, the boy had slipped off his lapti, and
was stepping softly and noiselessly upon the rugs that strewed
the floor. Surely he was close to him now&mdash;his breath was
touching his very cheek. All unconsciously the name escaped
his lips, and he called aloud, “Feodor!”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="ru" lang="ru">Dädushka</i>” the voice he loved seemed to answer.</p>

<p>“O God!” sobbed the old man, for the first time completely
unnerved, “leave me my senses. Do not let me lose myself in
vain delirious dreams. Grant that I may give up my soul to
thee in peace.”</p>

<p>“Dädushka, do not be afraid. It is I&mdash;it is your little
Feodor.” And now he knew it was no dream, for Feodor’s arms
were around him, Feodor’s face was buried in his breast.</p>

<p>“Did you think I could leave you, dädushka? Did you
think I could really go away with the others? Of course I
pretended to go; but I watched my opportunity, slipped off,
and came back to you as soon as I dared. I have been hiding
ever since.”</p>

<p>“My child, my child, I must send you from me.”</p>

<p>“Dädushka, you must not, for I cannot go. Listen&mdash;I have
sworn upon bended knees before the picture of my saint that
where you die there will I die also.”</p>

<p>“My boy, I cannot have it&mdash;the old have so little life to
give, the young so much!”</p>

<p>“Dädushka, I will not live after you; for am I not yours
altogether? My mother is dead, and my father too. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
have ever been to me instead of both. I have nothing in the
world but you. But what need of words?” said the boy, drawing
up his slender figure to its full height; “<em>I have sworn</em>.”</p>

<p>Petrovitch could not see how his young face glowed, and his
dark eyes shone like lamps of fire; but he heard the tones of
his voice, which had in them the ring of a steadfast purpose,
not proud or self-confident, scarcely even passionate, only full
of a quiet resolute persuasion that he was doing something to
which God had called him.</p>

<p>The old man’s reverence for the sanctity of an oath was rendered
stronger by a tinge of superstition. Moreover, he thought
this world&mdash;where apparently and for the present the infidel
Nyemtzi were victorious&mdash;not such a safe and happy home that
true hearts need mourn to leave it. Perhaps it would even be
well for him to take his dearest treasure with him to the better
land, and bring Maria Petrovna the little one she had intrusted
to his care. Thus it was that when once more Feodor whispered
softly, “And I too, dädushka,&mdash;I am glad to die for the
Czar,” he only answered, “For our monarch, our country, and
our God. May he accept the sacrifice, and receive our souls
into his kingdom.”</p>

<p>Just then a servant hastily entered the room. “Father,” he
said, in great agitation, “a horseman is galloping through the
streets, crying aloud that the French are coming. Their standards
may be seen, he says, upon the Sparrow Hill. And,
father,” he added, “the kibitka is ready, according to your
orders.”</p>

<p>“Then give me thine arm, Feodor,” said the old man rising.
“Our hour has come.”</p>

<span class="smcap1 t">The</span> slow hours that had dragged their weary length
since the evacuation of the doomed city began,
seemed a lifetime to Ivan. He almost felt as
if the suspense, the dull, hushed lull of expectation
that was not hope and yet was scarcely fear, would never
end. But the end came at length, and from that hour events
followed each other with tremendous, bewildering rapidity.</p>

<p>Ivan was in the Kremlin, distributing arms to the workmen
whom he found there, when some one cried that the French
were fording the Moskva (the Russian general, Miloradovitch,
having broken down the bridges). Ivan sprang to the nearest
point of observation, and saw some horsemen in fantastic uniforms,
and bringing with them a couple of guns, actually crossing
the stream. A personage, splendidly attired and surrounded
by a brilliant staff, was directing their movements, and apparently
preparing to follow them. This, though Ivan knew
it not, was Murat, King of Naples, who was leading the
French vanguard, thirsting for glory and plunder, and already
devouring with covetous eyes the fabulous treasures of the
Kremlin.</p>

<p>Ivan returned to his companions. “God has delivered them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
into our hands,” he said. “We will let them cross the ford,
and then&mdash;”</p>

<p>What followed may be learned from Murat’s own confession
found in an intercepted letter to his wife. “Never in my
life,” wrote the King of Naples, “was I in such wild danger.”
First a sharp fire of musketry saluted the advancing French;
then the workmen and the populace sprang upon them “with
maniac fury,” and fought “like demons.” The two pieces of
cannon which Murat had with him, and which were loaded
with grape-shot, eventually decided the contest, but not until
a colonel of engineers and a large number of soldiers had
fallen.</p>

<p>After the fray Michael saw Ivan, covered with dust and
mortar, leaning against a wall which had just been struck by a
shot. “Are you hurt, Barrinka?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” said Ivan, shaking the mortar from his clothes; “I
am all right. And you too, I hope? We must not throw
away our lives, Michael; there is too much still to be done.
Come with me to the prison.”</p>

<p>“Anywhere with you, Barrinka. See, though I could not
use a gun, I have killed Nyemtzi.” And Michael triumphantly
displayed a short sabre dyed with blood.</p>

<p>“Where did you get that?” asked Ivan.</p>

<p>“Took it from one of themselves. That is French blood upon
the blade,” said Michael, with an air of intense satisfaction.</p>

<p>The Wertsch palace was directly in their way, and Ivan
went in, saying, with a determined air, “I will hear no more
excuses from the countess now. Go she must; her hour has
come.”</p>

<p>Her hour had come&mdash;in a sense other and more solemn than
Ivan meant. The waiting-woman Maria met him in the saloon,
and told him with many tears that her mistress was dying.
At the tidings that the French had actually entered holy Moscow,
so terrible was her agitation that she had broken a blood-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>vessel,
and was now beyond the reach of human aid.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> Ivan
despatched a messenger for Pope Yefim&mdash;the only priest he
knew who had not left the city&mdash;while he himself hastened
to the side of the dying woman, to whom he thought his
presence might be a comfort.</p>

<p>He was too late. The countess had sunk into a state of
unconsciousness, and only faint occasional sighs showed that
life lingered still. As he stood in the darkened room beside
the motionless form, thoughts of death, at once more solemn
and more true than any that had come to him before, stole
into his heart. There was a sense of reality about this slow
sinking of the powers of nature which he had not felt in
any of the wild and stormy perils he had braved and was
braving still. That living soul, that personal mind and will,
but yesterday so pronounced and active, where was it? Whither
was it going? Ivan did not know. With him all the
future was mist and fog&mdash;“a land of darkness, as darkness
itself.” And for a moment his strong heart almost quailed as
there swept over it those old yet ever new apprehensions and
doubts, those</p>

<span class="i2">“Blank misgivings of a creature<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moving about in worlds not realized.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But this mood passed as quickly as it came. He dared not
linger; every moment was of importance now. With one sad
look of farewell he went his way, and was soon absorbed in
preparations for the great and terrible sacrifice which was
approaching so quickly.</p>

<p>He did not forget to send a messenger to the dwelling of
Petrovitch to learn the latest tidings of the heroic old man;
and was told that he had left the house, with his grandson
Feodor, on the first intimation of the approach of the French.</p>

<p>The first regiment of Frenchmen who advanced that day
along the great Smolensko road to the Gate of Triumph could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
have told Ivan something more. Just outside the gate, under
a green and spreading oak-tree, sat a venerable old man, with
hair and beard of silver whiteness; while beside him stood a
slight, tall stripling of some sixteen summers. The boy held a
gun in his hand, and as the French advanced, he took deliberate
aim at their leader, who was conspicuous on his stately horse,
his plumed cap waving in the wind. In a moment more the
horse was riderless and the plumes were trailing in the dust.</p>

<p>This was the signal for a dozen Frenchmen with drawn sabres
to spring at once upon the old man and the boy. “It is I
whom you ought to kill,” cried Petrovitch; “for it was I who
armed him and bade him fire upon you.” Feodor meanwhile
took two pistols from his belt and discharged them against his
assailants; then drawing a poniard, he defended his aged grandfather,
until at last he fell overpowered by numbers and covered
with wounds. Nor did the snow-white hairs of the patriarch
save him from the same fate.</p>

<p>It is said that an hour afterwards Napoleon passed the spot
attended by his staff. With a look of horror he turned away
and drew his horse to the other side of the road, saying to
those around him, “Such a venerable old man! It was a
cowardly murder.”</p>

<p>Night fell over the doomed city, and a full moon illumined
its fair minarets and domes with a robe of silver light. But
to the French, as they entered, it seemed like the deserted
camp of the Syrians&mdash;“Behold, there was no man there, neither
voice of man,” except a few trembling servants, who led the
conquerors into the abandoned dwellings of their lords, and
showed them the rich furniture, the costly provisions, the rare
wines which they had left behind them. In some cases even
the unfinished embroidery of the ladies was found lying as it
had fallen from their hands.</p>

<p>Yet the city had not surrendered to the enemy. No one
brought the keys to Napoleon; no one entreated his mercy or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
deprecated his vengeance. The strange silence touched even
his haughty soul with surprise and misgiving. In all Moscow
there remained not one person with whom he could communicate,
not one of sufficient importance to answer his inquiries or
to receive and execute his commands. The only official he
could find was the director of the Foundling Hospital, who
had refused to desert his helpless little flock at the coming of
the wolf.</p>

<p>The Bourse and the buildings around it were already wrapped
in flames when the French entered the city; but the immense
extent of Moscow prevented anything like a general alarm,
and the first four-and-twenty hours of the Occupation passed
quietly away. On the following night, however&mdash;a night
much to be remembered in the annals of Russia, of Europe, and
of freedom, that of the 15th of September&mdash;the sad Russian
host on its weary march, and the immense crowd of weeping
fugitives that followed it, beheld a sight magnificent indeed
but most terrible. A sheet of flame, fanned by a tempestuous
wind, grew and spread until it wrapped the wide extent of the
devoted city like a shroud of fire. The entire horizon was
illuminated. Three quarters of a league away men could see
to read by the lurid light. Nor did the dawn of day bring any
respite to the horror. The sun turned sickening from the scene,
its pale beams unable to contend with that fierce red glare.
Another sun arose, and yet another;&mdash;still the conflagration
raged. It took six awful days and nights to consume that
holocaust, the grandest the world has ever seen. But when at
last the flames died slowly out, nine-tenths of the ancient capital
of the Czar were laid in ashes.</p>

<span class="smcap1 a">Amidst</span> the splendid environs of St. Petersburg,
where Art has done all in her power to atone for
the sparing hand with which Nature has strewn
her bounties, there is a picturesque group of wooded
islets embraced by the clear blue waters of the Neva, and conspicuous
for the splendour of the “datcha,” or country houses,
which adorn them. One of these islets, called Kamenoi-Ostrov,
or the stony island, contains an imperial residence, a castle surrounded
by gardens; and here, while Moscow was still in flames,
arrived Colonel Michaud, the eminent Sardinian engineer, with
a sad and heavy heart.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>He had travelled with the speed and almost in the style of a
courier. When he alighted from his unpretending vehicle at
the castle gate, he saw that the place had a deserted look; and
only a single Cossack, who happened to be on duty as sentinel,
perceived his approach. Although the Emperor was still here,
even his very guards had been despatched to the seat of war.
Michaud briefly gave his name, and asked for an audience.</p>

<p>He was introduced at once into the cabinet of the Czar.
Alexander looked worn and anxious; young as he was, a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
threads of silver showed themselves already in his chestnut hair.
He saluted Michaud courteously; but asked immediately, with
a keen and searching look, “Do you not bring me sad tidings,
colonel?”</p>

<p>“Very sad, sire;&mdash;the evacuation of Moscow.”</p>

<p>“Have they given up my ancient capital without a struggle?”</p>

<p>“Sire, the environs of Moscow offer no position in which we
could hazard a battle with our inferior forces. The marshal<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>
thought he did well in preserving your army, whose loss without
saving Moscow would have been of the greatest consequence;
and which, by the reinforcements your Majesty has just procured,
and which I met everywhere along my road, will soon
resume the offensive, and make the French repent of invading
Russia.”</p>

<p>“Has the enemy actually entered the city?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sire. At this moment Moscow is in ashes. I left it
in flames.” Here Michaud stopped abruptly, for the agony
depicted on the Emperor’s face, “the expression of his eyes,”
completely unmanned him,&mdash;he could say no more.</p>

<p>It was Alexander who, after a few bitter moments, and maintaining
his self-control with a strong effort, resumed the conversation.</p>

<p>“I see that God requires from us great sacrifices. I am
ready to submit to his will. But, Michaud, tell me frankly,
what of the army? What do my soldiers say upon seeing my
ancient capital abandoned without a struggle? Must not this
have exercised a most disastrous influence upon the spirit of the
troops?”</p>

<p>“Sire, may I speak to you quite frankly, and as a loyal
soldier?”</p>

<p>“Colonel, I have always required this frankness; now I
entreat of you to use it. Hide nothing from me: I desire
absolutely to know the truth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
“Sire, I left all the army, from the generals to the meanest
soldier, possessed with one overpowering and terrible fear&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How? Whence these fears? Are my Russians overcome
by the first misfortune?” the Czar interrupted with emotion
which even he could not restrain, and which, as Michaud says,
“altered for a moment the noble calm of his fine features.”</p>

<p>“Never, sire!” resumed the colonel. “Their one fear is
that your Majesty, out of kindness of heart, may be persuaded
to make peace. They are burning to fight for you, and to prove
their devotion by the sacrifice of their lives.”</p>

<p>At these heroic words the light flashed once more across the
clouded face of Alexander. “You reassure me, colonel,” he
said. “Well then, return to the army. Say to our brave men,
say to all my subjects wherever you meet them, that if I had
not a soldier left, I should put myself at the head of my dear
nobles, of my faithful peasants, and expend to the uttermost the
resources of my empire. They are greater than my enemies
think. But if it be the will of God that my dynasty shall cease
to reign upon the throne of my ancestors, then&mdash;after having
done all else that man can do&mdash;I will let my beard grow to
this,” said Alexander, placing his hand upon his breast, “and I
will eat potatoes like the lowest of my mujiks, rather than sign
the humiliation of my country and of my dear people, whose
sacrifices for my sake I appreciate.” Here his voice failed: it
was easier to speak of his own ruin than of the love of his subjects.
Greatly moved, he turned away from Michaud, and
walked to the other end of the cabinet. But he came back
almost immediately with long and rapid strides, and a face that
had quickly changed from a deadly pallor to a fiery flush. Pressing
his hand on the arm of the officer, he said, “Colonel
Michaud, do not forget my words; perhaps one day we shall
remember them with pleasure. Napoleon or I&mdash;I or Napoleon&mdash;we
can no longer reign together. I know him now; he shall
never deceive me again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
“Sire,” cried the colonel joyfully, “your Majesty signs in
this moment the glory of the nation and the deliverance of
Europe.”</p>

<p>His words were true&mdash;with this qualification, that the glory
of Russia and the deliverance of Europe were not the work of
a moment, but of long months of patient, heroic resolution.
Alexander had not wished for war&mdash;perhaps, indeed, he had
striven too long to avert it. Personally, in his earlier years, he
admired Napoleon: the fact is undeniable, though it has been
the subject of much exaggeration. From the dawn of manhood
his favourite dream had been of a universal and durable peace,
and he imagined he saw in the victories of Napoleon so many
steps to its attainment. What are now called “Les idées Napoléoniques,”
seem to have captivated for a season this young,
ardent, somewhat visionary mind. But the veil once torn
from his eyes by the insatiable ambition and the repeated perfidies
of the French usurper, thenceforward it was between them
war to the death.</p>

<p>When Napoleon suddenly poured his enormous hosts across
the Niemen, Alexander at once and emphatically announced
his resolution, “I will not sheathe the sword while a single
foreigner remains in arms upon the soil of Russia.” At that
moment the eyes of all Europe were upon him, and neither
friend nor foe believed it possible that he could make good his
word.</p>

<p>“Napoleon,” said an astute observer, “thought he could
terrify the Emperor of Russia by his menaces without drawing
a sword; he thought he could make him lose his head by
beginning the war suddenly in the midst of negotiations; he
thought he could end that war by a single battle. But nothing
happened that he thought.”<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> In a letter written by him about
this time, which was intercepted and brought to his rival, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
these words: “Alexander is a child. I will make him weep tears
of blood.” Alexander upon reading it remarked: “He said to
me himself that in war determination always carries the day.
We shall see who has the most determination, he or I.”</p>

<p>But the determination of the strongest heart might well have
quailed before the perils that beset the Czar in this solemn
crisis of his own and his people’s history. Six hundred and
fifty thousand fighting men had crossed his border under a
leader hitherto invincible, whose name was the terror of the
civilized world. No man felt more keenly than Alexander his
own inferiority to Napoleon as a general. The bitter memory
of Austerlitz, his “unfortunate day,” never left him. Nor had
he any commander whose surpassing merit might inspire the
army with confidence. The excellent Barclay de Tolly had unfortunately
become so unpopular both with the army and the
nation, that Alexander, though with much regret, was obliged
to remove him. Of his successor, the aged Kutusov, he had
no very high opinion; but when everything depended upon the
cordial support of his people, he was in a manner obliged to
consult their wishes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the French were marching onwards into the very
heart of the country. The retreat of the Russians before them
was no doubt a master-stroke of policy, but to the sovereign of
Russia it was unutterably painful. From the thought of the sufferings
of his people,&mdash;the murders, the plundering, the desolation,&mdash;his
sensitive heart recoiled in horror. Nearer and nearer
came the fiery deluge, leaving a track of ruin behind it. Consternation
seized his counsellors, his court, his very family. The
foreign envoys at St. Petersburg packed up their effects in readiness
for an immediate flight. Even the Grand Duke Constantine
made the hard task of the brother he idolized harder still
by assuring every one that the French would inevitably conquer,&mdash;it
was hopeless to resist them. He called for peace, it was
said, “as men call for water in a conflagration.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
To aggravate and crown all this misery, dejection, and terror,
came the overwhelming tidings of the destruction of Moscow.
In some ways it was a calamity more bitter, more crushing than
that of St. Petersburg would have been. While the one was
the official capital, the other was the real heart of the old Muscovite
empire. Here the Czars were baptized, were crowned, were
buried; here were heaped all the treasures, were concentrated
all the glories of their past. It was their holy city, their Jerusalem.
No one knew as yet that its destruction had been a
signal act of patriotism and self-sacrifice; almost all the world,
including the Czar himself, believed that the French had consummated
their atrocities by setting fire to the city. Nor could
he or others foresee the future, or discern at once amidst the
dust and smoke of the conflict that the victory, in truth, was
won. The final hour of Napoleon’s triumph had struck, but
the toll of fate was audible neither to friend nor foe; and to
Alexander and to Russia the day that saw the fall of Moscow
seemed the darkest that had ever dawned upon them.</p>

<p>In the heart of Alexander it left “a profound and bitter sorrow,”
which neither time, nor victory, nor glory could ever
wholly obliterate. Long afterwards, when conquered France
offered the conqueror pecuniary compensation, he answered
with proud sadness, “Gold can never give me Moscow back
again.” Yet not for one moment did his courage fail or his
determination falter. His wife implored him with tears to
make peace, or to allow her to leave the empire. His mother,
less submissive, actually prepared to go. He gently dissuaded
her from a course so injurious to the interests of the country,
and at last, when she refused to listen, he said firmly, “I have
entreated you as a son; I now command you as your sovereign.
You shall not go.” Amidst the universal panic he alone stood
firm. Naturally susceptible, tender-hearted, perhaps even irresolute,
the hour of trial found him undaunted as the fiercest of
his barbarian ancestors. Like the delicate mainspring of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
complicated machine which sustains a pressure that would
shatter a bar of iron, so this fine sensitive nature assumed the
best attributes of strength, and bore up triumphantly against a
world in arms.</p>

<p>Amongst the first words which he addressed to his people
after the fall of Moscow were these:&mdash;“An oppressed world
looks to us for encouragement, and can we shrink from the
honourable mission? Let us kiss the hand that selected us to
act as the leader of nations in the struggle for independence,
and contend with courage and constancy to obtain a durable
peace, not only for ourselves, but for those unhappy countries
forced by the tyrant to fight in his quarrel: it is glorious, it is
worthy of a great nation, to <em>render good for ill</em>.” The proclamation
ends with a prayer:&mdash;“Almighty God, is the cause for
which we are battling not just? Cast an eye of compassion on
our holy Church. Preserve to this people its courage and constancy.
Suffer it to triumph over its adversary and thine. May
it be in thy hand the instrument of his destruction; and in
delivering itself, redeem the independence of nations and of
kings.”</p>

<p>Here we recognize the secret of Alexander’s strength. He
knew himself in the hands of God; he and his people were
instruments to do his will.</p>

<p>Some years later he said to a friend, “The conflagration of
Moscow illumined my soul.” It certainly marked a crisis in his
spiritual history; but with souls the sudden illumination of a
tropical sunrise is the rare exception, while light “increasing
more and more unto the perfect day” is the ordinary rule. From
Alexander’s earliest years it had seemed as if God was drawing
his heart towards himself. While yet a little child he would
rise from his bed at night, and kneel unbidden to ask forgiveness
for some childish fault. Then and throughout his life his
tenderness of heart was remarkable. He “never willingly hurt
any living thing;” and so beautiful was the influence he exercised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
over his wayward brother Constantine, that a plan for
having the latter brought up amongst Greeks as their future
sovereign was abandoned, because it was wisely concluded that
no political advantage could counterbalance the loss of Alexander’s
example and companionship.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Empress Catherine had intrusted the education
of her favourite grandson to freethinkers like herself, of the
school of Voltaire and Diderot. He was early taught to look
upon all forms of religion as antiquated superstitions, useful,
perhaps, for the vulgar, but beneath the notice of the
wise. His natural benevolence was not discouraged, but
justice and humanity were inculcated to the utter exclusion
of piety.</p>

<p>With such an education, and while yet a boy, he was launched
upon the troubled sea of one of the most dissolute, frivolous,
and vicious courts in Europe. He did not wholly escape contamination,
but all the dreams of his youth were noble and
lofty. To be the benefactor of his kind, to free the oppressed&mdash;such
were the visions he nursed in solitude or breathed into the
ear of a sympathizing friend during the long walks in which he
delighted. The voice of God was never quite silent in his heart.
He himself says that with regard to religion, “things were at
the court of St. Petersburg very much as everywhere else&mdash;many
words, but little meaning; many outward practices, but
the holy essence of Christianity was hidden from our eyes. I
felt the void in my soul, and a vague presentiment accompanied
me everywhere. I went&mdash;I came&mdash;I sought to distract my
thoughts.”</p>

<p>The void within of which he spoke was deepened by sorrow.
During the reign of his father, who disliked and dreaded him as
a rival, his position was both difficult and painful. Personally,
he was submissive and patient; but he was brave in interceding
for the oppressed, and in using for the good of others any
measure of authority that was allowed him. After four years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
the tragedy which terminated the reign of the unfortunate Paul
placed the imperial crown upon the head of Alexander, but cast
a shadow over his life which never wholly passed away. To
his latest hour, in every period of sorrow or despondency, “the
agony returned.” It was not exactly remorse, for he was
guiltless; but it was poignant grief and horror. It deepened
that inherited tendency to morbid gloom and depression which
perhaps, even amidst the happiest surroundings, might have
developed as years went by.</p>

<p>In one of these sorrowful moods he confessed his dejection to
an intimate friend, hinting that he envied him his unfailing
cheerfulness. Prince Galitzin told him in reply that he had
found in the Bible the source of true comfort and happiness.
The story was a remarkable one. Early in his reign Alexander
nominated Galitzin “Minister of Public Worship.” “But I
know nothing about religion,” objected the Prince, who, like his
master, had been educated in an atmosphere of French infidelity.
“That is a point in your favour,” replied the philosophic Czar.
“It will secure your impartiality. You have only to hold the
balance even, and do justice to every one.” But Galitzin, not
quite satisfied, asked Archbishop Plato to recommend him some
book which would give him a knowledge of religion. The
venerable metropolitan advised him to read the Bible; which he
did, at first very reluctantly, afterwards with ever deepening
interest and profit.</p>

<p>Alexander determined to follow the example of his friend,
and next day surprised the Empress Elizabeth by asking her to
lend him a Bible. She gave him a French copy of the Sacred
Word&mdash;De Sacy’s translation, printed at Cologne&mdash;and it
became thenceforward his inseparable companion. For a long
time he was haunted by sceptical doubts; but he persevered in
his study, and the shadows that obscured his soul gradually and
slowly passed away.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the general unbelief and indifference of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
higher classes, there were at that time in the Russian court a
few “devout and honourable women,” who were earnestly seeking
light from above. To these the Czar was an object of
interest, as “not far from the kingdom of heaven.” When the
French war was impending, and the burden of anxiety from
which few hearts were free was known to weigh most heavily
upon his, a message, which proved to be indeed from God, came
to him through one of them. It was the night before he
started for Vilna, and, according to his usual custom, he was
spending it in transacting business, content to find what sleep
he could in his open carriage while dashing at headlong
speed through the country. As he was diligently arranging
his papers, a lady entered his cabinet unannounced, and looking
up in great surprise he recognized the wife of his Grand
Marshal, the Countess Tolstoi. She apologized for her unseasonable
visit, and put a paper into his hand, which she
entreated him to read, saying he would find true comfort there.
His unfailing courtesy led him to accept it and thank her; and
she withdrew. He put the paper in his pocket, resumed his
occupation, and thought no more of it until, after two days and
nights of rapid travel, he changed his clothes for the first time.
Upon removing his coat he found it, and saw that it was a copy
of the ninety-first psalm. He lay down; but, worn out with
fatigue, was unable to sleep, so he called his chaplain and requested
him to read to him. Strangely enough, the portion
which the priest selected was that very psalm, and the Czar
was greatly impressed by the coincidence.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> The glorious words
of promise, so exactly suited to his need, were received with
simple faith. From that day forward he said of the Lord,
“He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I
trust.”</p>

<p>His study of the Divine Word became more earnest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
systematic: from this period until the end of his life he read
three chapters daily, even under the most difficult circumstances,
“when the cannon were thundering about his tent.” He prayed
constantly, “using no form,” as he said himself, “but the
words which God’s Spirit taught him, according to his needs.”
And he sought to conform his conduct to the will of God, so
far as he understood it.</p>

<p>This was not done without a struggle. His life had not been
blameless, and much once dear had to be surrendered. But
henceforward his court became a model of purity; and moreover
his fear of God showed itself in an increase of gentleness
towards man. He made great efforts to control his naturally
passionate temper; and if, after this period, he was betrayed
into a hasty expression, he would frankly apologize, not only
to a member of his suite, but even to the humblest of his
attendants.</p>

<p>He had always known that his enormous power was intrusted
to him for the good of others, not for his own happiness
or glory. “Fifty millions of men are worth more than one
man,” had been an axiom with him from the beginning of his
reign. But now he knew himself the steward of God, responsible
to <em>him</em> for its exercise. “You should be in my place,”
he said to a friend, “to understand what is the responsibility
of a sovereign, and what I feel when I reflect that one
day I must render an account of the life of every one of my
soldiers.”</p>

<p>Amongst the commands of Christ which impressed him most
deeply were these: “Love your enemies: do good to them that
hate you.” He learned to forgive personal injuries, “which in
other reigns would have drawn down thunder.” One instance
amongst many may be given. Admiral Tchichagof, one of his
ministers, quarrelled with his colleagues, and at length withdrew
to Paris, where he said many bitter and injurious things
about the Czar, which were all reported to him, and probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
exaggerated. Just before the outbreak of the war, Tchichagof’s
wife died, and, in accordance with her last request, he brought
her body to St. Petersburg for interment. He wrote to the
Czar to inform him of his return and its reason; and Alexander
replied by an autograph letter, which Tchichagof showed in
confidence to his friend De Maistre. “What a letter!” wrote
the Sardinian ambassador to his sovereign. “The most tender
and most delicate friend could not have written otherwise.”
And he said to Tchichagof, as he handed back the precious
paper, “You ought to die for the prince who wrote you that
letter.” An interview followed, in which the reconciliation was
cemented. “I know what you have said of me,” said Alexander,
“but I attribute all to a good motive.” Need it be
added that henceforward Tchichagof served him faithfully?</p>

<p>But what of the French&mdash;of Napoleon? What of his desolated
country, his murdered subjects, his fair and favourite city
laid in ashes? Could these things be forgiven? Or is it true,
as many would tell us, that the precepts of Christ are admirably
suited for women and children, perhaps, at the utmost, for
men in their private relations each with the other, but a nullity
or a failure when applied to larger scenes and interests, utterly
ineffectual to guide and control the statesman in his cabinet or
the monarch on his throne? We shall see how far the story of
Alexander answers this question.</p>

<p>For two or three years he might truly have been said to
“abide under the shadow of the Almighty,” although not as
yet did he “dwell in the secret place of the most High.” He
trusted in God, he sought to obey Christ, long before he knew

<span class="smcap1 o">One</span> evening towards the end of October, and just
when the first snow of the year was beginning to
fall, Ivan Pojarsky and Michael Ivanovitch entered
the head-quarters of the Russian army at Tarovtino.
Their fleet Arabian horses were flecked with foam, for they had
traversed the ten leagues which divided them from Moscow
without once drawing rein. As they dashed along, they shouted
to all whom they passed, “Napoleon has quitted Moscow!”
and answering “houras” and cries of joy cheered them on
their way.</p>

<p>“Bring us at once to Count Rostopchine,” said Ivan to the
soldiers who crowded around them. “He is here, is he
not?”</p>

<p>“He is here, gospodin; but the Marshal&mdash;”</p>

<p>“With all due respect to the dignity of his Highness the
General-in-Chief, our business is with the Count, brothers,”
returned Ivan.</p>

<p>He was accordingly conducted to the presence of Rostopchine,
who, after a lengthened interview, dismissed him to seek
rest and refreshment, desiring him to return early in the
morning.</p>

<p>Rostopchine’s aide-de-camp offered his hospitality, and Ivan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
thanked him courteously, but inquired whether Captain Adrian
Wertsch, of the Moscow militia, was not then in the camp.
The aide-de-camp answered in the affirmative, and agreed to
bring Ivan to his tent, though very reluctantly; for he was sorry
to lose the honour and pleasure of entertaining one who could
give him so many interesting details about the French occupation
of Moscow.</p>

<p>Adrian was standing outside his tent when Ivan approached,
and he greeted him with joyful astonishment, as one risen
from the dead.</p>

<p>“I did not think to see your face again,” he said.</p>

<p>“Life is still left me,” returned Ivan in a broken voice; for,
after so many horrors, the sight of a familiar face proved at
the moment almost more than he could bear.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said Adrian, drawing his arm affectionately
within his own. “A good draught of champagne is what you
want now.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell your orderly to take care of my friend
Michael Ivanovitch? He has behaved like a hero.”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>Adrian gave a few rapid directions, then led Ivan into his
tent, and before he would listen to a word, poured for him
a sparkling goblet of the beverage which he considered a
panacea for all the ills, mental and bodily, of the noble, as
vodka was for those of the mujik.</p>

<p>Ivan needed the stimulant, for he was worn out with fatigue
and excitement. He said, as he finished the draught, “You
got my letter, Adrian?”</p>

<p>“Yes. My poor mother!”</p>

<p>“No one was to blame. We did all we could, but nothing
would induce her to leave the old home; and when the French
entered Moscow, the shock was more than she could bear. We
buried her honourably, by the side of her husband, in the Church
of St. Eustacius. Pope Yefim performed the funeral services.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
“That was nobly done, Ivan, and I thank you most heartily.&mdash;By
the way, your friend Pope Yefim has made himself
famous.”</p>

<p>“How? By remaining in the city?”</p>

<p>“By daring to celebrate, with a solemn service, the Czar’s
coronation day, under the very beard of Napoleon.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> We have
all heard of it.”</p>

<p>“He never supposed he was doing anything extraordinary.
The Prior of the Dominican Monastery, whom he consulted,
agreed that he was right. I can tell you, Adrian, that good
man himself was by no means in love with his countrymen.
Though his religion is their own, and he kept his church open
the whole time of the Occupation, scarcely a Frenchman
darkened its doors, except a few officers of noble birth belonging
to the old <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">régime</i>. As a rule, the soldiers of Napoleon
are infidels. Sometimes, out of curiosity, they would stray
into our churches. On the coronation day, a poor young
fellow, a mere lad, stole into Pope Yefim’s church, and was
near paying dearly for his rashness; for a party of mujiks set
upon him after the service, taking him for a spy. They might
have killed him; but&mdash;strangest chance of all&mdash;my friend
Michael, whose thoughts by day and dreams by night are only
of slaying Nyemtzi, interposed to save this one, saying he knew
him, and had received a kindness at his hands. I spoke to the
youth, and he told me he had been religiously brought up, and
said the very sound of a church-bell, and the sight of men
kneeling in prayer, seemed to do him good, though he could not
understand a word of the service.”</p>

<p>“A queer taste,” said Adrian, shrugging his shoulders. Then
to his orderly, who had just entered the tent, “Bring us the
best supper you can get, and more champagne.”</p>

<p>“Adrian,” asked Ivan, “where is Leon?”</p>

<p>Adrian’s face assumed a sorrowful expression. “Gone to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
our mother,” he answered. “He was wounded at Borodino,
though not severely. He insisted upon going out again, and
met his death in a skirmish ten days ago.”</p>

<p>Ivan felt and showed real sorrow. Of the two companions
of his youth, Leon had been his favourite, and he could not
hear unmoved the tidings of his death. “Death&mdash;death everywhere,”
he murmured sadly.</p>

<p>“Come, my friend,” said Adrian kindly, “you must not give
way. It is only the fate of war. You have been so long in
that horrible den of a city that your nerves are shattered.
Take some more wine.”</p>

<p>“That horrible den!” Ivan repeated. “A lair of wild
beasts! Such it has been indeed. The count, who is as hard
as <em>this</em>,” laying his hand upon Adrian’s iron camp-bedstead,
“has been asking me for reports and descriptions. I cannot
describe, I can scarcely even report facts. Picture to yourself
nine-tenths of the town in ashes&mdash;or in charred blackened
ruins&mdash;with thousands of the wretched inhabitants, who
could not, or did not, make good their escape, wandering
about homeless and starving, filling the air with their lamentations.
Then think of the French, like a host of demons
turned loose upon their prey, ransacking the smoking ruins
in search of plunder. I have seen the gold-laced uniform
of the general and the woollen jacket of the private side by
side, contending for the spoils of our desolated homes; while
all the dangerous classes, all the thieves and ruffians who are to
be found amongst the scum of the populace in every great city,
joined them in the horrible work and added to the confusion
and misery.”</p>

<p>“Did not Napoleon shoot or hang a great number of our
people?”</p>

<p>“If you call three hundred a great number; so many at
least he executed as incendiaries&mdash;and indeed most of them
were taken in the act. They died in silence, without asking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
for mercy, and without accusing any one as having instigated
them to the deed.”</p>

<p>“How did <em>you</em> escape?” asked Adrian.</p>

<p>“There was little difficulty in escaping. It was easy enough
to hide in the ruins or in the cellars, many of which had been
left well stocked with provisions when the city was abandoned.
But have you heard about our wounded men?” he asked, with
a return of animation, and even of something like cheerfulness.</p>

<p>“No; I have heard nothing.”</p>

<p>“The count was obliged to leave two thousand men, who
were too desperately wounded to bear removal, concealed in
the cellars of the city. Here they managed to drag on their
lives, though in a state of extreme wretchedness. We found
them out, and used to bring them food and other comforts.
That work was even more hazardous than setting the city on
fire; for discovery would have cost, not our lives alone, but
theirs. Napoleon’s last act before he left the city was to order
ten sick men, found in a cellar, to be shot.”</p>

<p>“Wretch!” cried Adrian, clenching his hand.</p>

<p>“The half has not been told you, or you would find no name
to call him by,” returned Ivan fiercely. “He has defiled our
holiest sanctuaries; he has torn open our imperial tombs; he
has stabled his horses in the church where our Czar was
crowned; he has carried everything away upon which he
could lay his sacrilegious hands, even to the cross upon the
tower of Ivan Veliki, and the Tartar banners which hung as
trophies in the Arsenal. Well may Count Rostopchine curse
him, as only he knows how to curse. But those wounded&mdash;we
contrived somehow to keep them alive; and I think a
goodly number may be saved yet. I asked the count not to
lose an hour in sending them succour.”</p>

<p>“I hope he has had the grace to do justice to your courage
and your exertions.”</p>

<p>“He has condescended to approve my conduct,” said Ivan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
with modest satisfaction. “And now he offers me three
things, by way of recompense, as he is pleased to say. If
I choose to return with him to the city, he will give me an
appointment in the civil service, with the rank of titular counsellor,
which, as you know, answers to that of senior captain in
the army.”<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>“Surely you will not do that! You could not sheathe your
sword <em>now</em>,” Adrian exclaimed.</p>

<p>“So much I said to the count; and he answered that, if I
pleased, he would request the marshal to put me on his staff.”</p>

<p>“Capital! What more could you desire?”</p>

<p>“He made another proposal&mdash;to send me to the Czar with
the report of what I had seen and done.”</p>

<p>“And which did you accept?”</p>

<p>“<em>The last</em>,” said Ivan. At that moment a sound, dull, prolonged,
and loud, like distant thunder, smote upon their ears.
Again it came, and yet again, making the air tremble around
them and the earth shake beneath their feet. “What is that?”
cried Ivan.</p>

<p>“Not musketry or cannon,” said Adrian, with a look of
alarm and perplexity. “We are tolerably familiar with those
sounds. <em>This</em> is different.”</p>

<p>“More like an explosion&mdash;if so, a terrible one. Perhaps a
great powder magazine. But where?” mused Ivan.</p>

<p>Adrian hurried out in search of information, and soon returned
to tell his friend that the noise evidently came from
the direction of Moscow. More than that no one knew.</p>

<p>Morning brought the explanation. Ivan was still enjoying
the profound slumber of youth and weariness, when a brother
officer of Adrian’s rushed into the tent. “The Kremlin is destroyed!”
he cried. “That demon Napoleon had it undermined
before he left, and last night it was blown into fragments!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
“The Kremlin?&mdash;Impossible!” cried Adrian, who was dressing
for parade.</p>

<p>“Too possible, and too true,” said his informant. “A messenger
from the city has just arrived to bring the tidings to
the marshal and the count.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ivan, who had been suddenly awakened, started
up in horror, exclaiming, “The Czar! oh, what will it be to
<em>him</em>?”</p>

<p>“Blown into fragments, did you say?” returned Adrian.
“Utterly impossible! The masonry is as solid as the rocks
beneath our feet, and the walls of the arsenal are three yards
in thickness.”</p>

<p>“Those walls are now level with the ground,” said the
officer; “and the palace&mdash;the Czar’s ancient palace&mdash;is in ruins.”</p>

<p>Ivan uttered a bitter cry, and Adrian asked breathlessly,
“What of the churches?”</p>

<p>“One of them, I have not heard which, is thrown down.
The mines were fired by slow-consuming fusees; and our men,
who arrived just before the messenger left, were beginning
a perilous search for powder, to prevent further mischief, if
they could.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Ivan, who had risen now,&mdash;“but there must be
a mistake somewhere; for the French kept their own sick and
wounded in the Kremlin, and I happen to know that those
unfit to be moved were still there when I left the city. That
Napoleon could have exposed <em>them</em> to a horrible death is simply
inconceivable.”</p>

<p>“Yet too true,” the officer answered. “He has sacrificed
his own helpless followers to his revenge and hatred. For this
barbarous deed can have had no other motive. There was
nothing to be gained by it.”</p>

<p>Adrian laid his hand upon Ivan’s shoulder. “Do not go to
St Petersburg,” he said. “Stay with us, and fight. We will
pay this Napoleon double for all his atrocities.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
“I wish his neck were <em>there</em>,” said Adrian’s comrade, grinding
the earth with his strong heel. “But I would not kill
him,” he added, after a pause. “No. I would drag him in
chains to the feet of the Czar, and let <em>him</em> kill him with his
own hand.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Ivan slowly and with deliberation,&mdash;“I
think every Russian, from the Czar himself down to the lowest
mujik, should swear a solemn oath not to sheathe the sword
until we have taken such vengeance upon Napoleon and his
Frenchmen as the world has never yet seen.”</p>

<p>“So be it,” said Michael, who came in while he was speaking.
“I, a mujik, will be the first to swear.&mdash;Barrinka, what
is the name of Napoleon’s great city, where he has his palace
and all his treasures? Suppose the Czar were to make a blaze
of <em>that</em> some day! It may be. God is just!”</p>

<span class="smcap1 w">When</span> Ivan waited upon Count Rostopchine that
morning, he found his excellency in a very bad
humour. The destruction of the Kremlin was
perhaps enough to account for this; but there may
have been in addition an altercation with Marshal Kutusov&mdash;not
a very rare occurrence, for between the general-in-chief of
the army and the governor of Moscow there was no friendship.
Ivan found the count surrounded by the members of his suite,
to whom he was giving directions in preparation for an immediate
return to the city.</p>

<p>“Do you come with us, Ivan Ivanovitch?” he asked abruptly,
and of course in Russian, the only language he would tolerate
in his presence, although he himself spoke and wrote French
with elegance and precision.</p>

<p>Ivan saluted him with due respect, but answered in the
negative.</p>

<p>“Ah! then I shall have the trouble of speaking to the
marshal about you,” returned the count, with an air of annoyance,
at which Ivan was scarcely surprised, for Rostopchine’s
manner on the preceding evening had made him fully aware
that he desired to retain him in his own service. So he
answered deferentially, “Instead of imposing that trouble upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
your excellency, I shall avail myself of the third proposal you
did me the honour to make, and very humbly entreat of you
to intrust me with despatches for his Imperial Majesty.”</p>

<p>Ivan was utterly amazed at the count’s reception of this request.
“Then you are as great a fool as I took you for the first
day I saw your face. And,” added Rostopchine, with one of his
resounding Russian oaths, “you could not possibly be a greater!”</p>

<p>Such an address from such a personage, and in the presence
of a score of witnesses, might well have disconcerted an older
man than Ivan, especially as he could not in the least imagine
the cause of it. But to every one’s astonishment he stood his
ground, and answered with the utmost coolness and self-possession,
“Your excellency’s opinion may be correct, but it must
have some better foundation than my choosing to embrace an
offer which you yourself condescended to make to me last night.”</p>

<p>“He sees no difference between last night and this morning,”
remarked Rostopchine, turning to his officers, but speaking in
a voice quite loud enough for Ivan to hear. “He is in a
mighty hurry to go and tell the Czar that the Kremlin is destroyed.”
Then addressing Ivan directly&mdash;“I understand you
perfectly, young gentleman: you prefer the air of a court to
that of a camp, and had rather dangle your feet in the Czar’s
ante-chamber than use your hands fighting the French.”</p>

<p>If Ivan had not just been performing most hazardous services
with signal intrepidity, he might have been angry. But
he knew that no one present doubted his courage for an instant,
Rostopchine perhaps least of all. So he only bowed, and
answered with extreme <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sang-froid</i>, “That being the case, when
shall I have the honour of waiting upon your excellency to
receive your commands for St. Petersburg?”</p>

<p>“I will send them to you in half-an-hour; you need not
show your face here again.”<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Ivan returned to the tent of his friend with, strange to say,
a more cheerful air than when he left it. He seemed to be
rather exhilarated than otherwise by his encounter. “Every one
knows the count’s temper,” he said, after detailing the adventure.
“I was not going to lose the reward of all I have
passed through during the last six weeks for a few rough
words. Only for the hope of seeing the face of my Czar, and
telling him I tried to serve him faithfully, I should once and
again have lain down to die.”</p>

<p>“It is well known,” answered Adrian, “that Count Rostopchine
does not love the Czar&mdash;but he loves Russia.” Then,
to Ivan’s surprise, Adrian told him that he himself hoped
to be the companion of his rapid journey to St. Petersburg.
His mother’s death had left the pecuniary affairs of the Wertsch
family in confusion, and of course the intervention of “government”
was necessary for their arrangement. Amongst other
matters, the term of years for which one of their estates had
been granted by the crown was now expired, and a new grant
would have to be solicited. While Ivan was engaged with the
count, Adrian had asked for and obtained a short leave of absence,
that he might take advantage of his friend’s telega; for
Ivan, as one travelling upon public business, would be authorized
to require, at every post-house, the swiftest horses
that could be obtained.</p>

<p>This explanation had not long been finished, when a fine
young man, the son of Rostopchine, entered the tent. He
brought Ivan his father’s letter to the Czar, and the other
documents necessary for his journey. Then he offered him
a supply of money, which Ivan, under the circumstances,
was glad to be able to decline&mdash;the contents of a purse of
ducats, found accidentally in one of the abandoned palaces
of Moscow, sufficing for his present needs. Lastly, young
Rostopchine lingered to say, “My father desires me to tell
you that he has mentioned you to the Czar in very handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
terms, though not more so than you have fully deserved.”</p>

<p>Ivan was touched by this magnanimity, which was quite in
keeping with the character of the fiery and prejudiced but
honest and generous old Muscovite. He answered gratefully:
“I beg of you to present my very humble thanks to his excellency,
and to assure him I shall never forget the trust he
has reposed in me.”</p>

<p>Ivan, Adrian, and Michael were soon seated in a rough, light
telega and dashing across the country, under the guidance of
a practised driver, at a speed that almost anticipated the
age of railways. Until they passed beyond the theatre of
war, they had a guard of flying Cossacks; after that, they were
left to their own resources. They travelled day and night&mdash;Ivan
anxious and rather melancholy, Adrian enlivening their
way with his conversation. As they were drawing near
their journey’s end, he took occasion, from some remark
of Ivan’s, to explain to him the views of General Kutusov
with regard to the war. “Russia, says the marshal, is making
herself the champion and the martyr of Europe; and scanty
thanks will Europe give her for the same when once the common
danger is over. These English, Germans, and Swedes are
glad enough to see us shedding our best blood to overthrow the
despotism of Napoleon and secure the general freedom; but
when the work is done, which of them will have the grace to
be grateful to us? Rather will they envy us the very glory we
acquired in fighting their battles. Hence the marshal would
not be at all averse to an honourable peace, if such could be
had; and they say the Czar has had to interfere more than
once to prevent his opening negotiations with the enemy&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of which the enemy would be only too glad,” said Ivan.
“Our friend Yakovlef, who, as you are aware, was detained in
Moscow by the illness of his uncle, was taken before Napoleon,
who cajoled and threatened him by turns to try and induce him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
to bring a letter from him to the Czar. But young Yakovlef
stood firm; in fact, he told Napoleon he could not presume so
far, if his life depended upon it. The Czar’s refusal to receive
any proposition whatsoever from the French is absolute.
But surely I see buildings in the distance, and smoke.&mdash;Isvostchik,
can this be St. Petersburg?”</p>

<p>“Yes, gospodin, this is St. Petersburg.” Then, being himself
a native of Moscow, “But it is <em>not</em> Moscow the holy. Ah!
Moscow the holy will be never more what she was in the old
days.”</p>

<p>None of the party, except the driver, had seen the new
capital before. Adrian was full of natural curiosity and interest
in all that met their view as they drove along; while Michael
was busy wondering whether the Nyemtzi would come here
also, what sort of defence could be made if they did, and
whether a great many of them would be killed. But Ivan
grew silent and absorbed, and looked very pale. “I verily believe,”
said Adrian, turning to him suddenly, “that you are
seeing the horrors of Moscow over again.”</p>

<p>“No,” returned Ivan&mdash;“no. I was not thinking just then
of what I have seen, but of what I am about to see.”</p>

<p>“You are about to see the thing you have been longing for
through all your toils and perils. Rouse yourself, man! Of
what are you afraid?”</p>

<p>“Of the face of Majesty,” said Ivan to himself; though to
Adrian he only answered, with a rather nervous laugh, “First
interviews are trying.” Yet he knew that this was not, for
him, a first interview with his sovereign. He felt beneath his
doublet for the precious piece of gold, the cherished souvenir of
his boyhood, as if to assure himself that the great Emperor,
into whose presence he was going, was really the kind young
boyar who had promised that he should serve him one day.</p>

<p>“Dear Barrinka,” pleaded Michael, “do not forget to tell
our lord the Czar that a mujik who has lost one hand desires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
his leave to fight for him, and that he will serve him <em>so</em> faithfully.
At the camp,” he added, “they laughed at me, and told
me I would never make a soldier. But the Czar will listen
to <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>Ivan smiled doubtfully. In his heart he wished that the
poor mujik’s child-like idea of his sovereign had been his own
also. Then he saw Michael take out his beloved picture, and,
fastening it before him on the telega, address to it his prayers
for the success of his young lord’s mission. “The saint and
the Czar are equally real to him,” thought Ivan, “and he
would address either with equal reverence and equal confidence.”</p>

<p>His reverie was interrupted by the voice of the isvostchik.
“This is the square of the Admiralty, and there is the great
Czar Peter,” said he, as he pointed out the celebrated equestrian
statue where the father of modern Russia perpetually climbs
the rock and treads the serpent beneath his horse’s hoofs.</p>

<p>They drove to an inn, where Ivan merely delayed to make
those changes in his dress which etiquette imperatively demanded,
and then, leaving his companions to await his return,
took his despatches to the Winter Palace. There he was fortunate
enough to find the Emperor, who had just returned
from Kamenoi-Ostrov.</p>

<p>In less than two hours Ivan came back to the inn. Michael
had gone out with the isvostchik, but Adrian was waiting for
him, and met him with an air of some anxiety. “Is it well?”
he asked briefly.</p>

<p>“Well?&mdash;oh yes, <em>very</em> well,” Ivan answered. He spoke in
an abstracted voice, but there was a new light in his eyes, and
his face was flushed and excited.</p>

<p>“I cannot make you out,” said Adrian, looking at him with
surprise and curiosity. “If it were possible, I should say that
you look at once ten years older and ten years younger than
you did two hours ago.”</p>

<p>“Two hours! It ought to be ten years, if all&mdash;O Adrian!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
he broke out suddenly, and with uncontrollable emotion, “the
half was not told me! He is grand&mdash;beautiful! There is
only one thing more I want now&mdash;<em>to die for him</em>.”</p>

<p>The sorrows of the last two months had done somewhat to
deepen the slight nature of Adrian. He was no longer disposed
to scoff at everything. “I guessed ‘le séduisant,’ as Czernichef
calls him, would fascinate you,” he said. “But, now you <em>have</em>
returned, I will own that I wished you better news to bring
him than that of the destruction of the Kremlin. Evil tidings
do not always insure their bearer a good reception.”</p>

<p>“I think he was prepared,” Ivan answered. “At all events
he betrayed no emotion; only saying very calmly, ‘It is the
will of God!’ I think he grew pale, but even of that I cannot
speak certainly, as at the beginning of our interview I scarcely
dared to raise my eyes to his face. But all changed when he
spoke of Moscow, and questioned me about the things I had
witnessed there during the Occupation. I could see that much
was new to him, and even startling, and that my account of
the conflagration moved him deeply. Then all fear passed from
me, save the fear of giving pain to him. His intense gaze
seemed to draw the whole truth from my lips, even in spite of
my will; but it was hard to tell of the burnings and plunderings,
and of the starved, homeless, despairing people. Once or
twice my voice dropped so low that he had to ask me to repeat
my words; for you know he is somewhat deaf. But when I
told him of the wounded men whom we found in the cellars
and tried to keep alive, his face lighted up, and he thanked me&mdash;yes,
thanked <em>me</em>” Ivan repeated, raising his head proudly;
though almost immediately he allowed it to sink again, while a
vivid flush passed over his features.</p>

<p>“Tell me the rest,” said Adrian eagerly.</p>

<p>Ivan struggled with some feeling which he would not, perhaps
could not express. “It is almost too sacred,” he said at
last. “But I will tell you; only, never speak to me of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
again. Even now I look back upon what I said with amazement.
Evidently Count Rostopchine has been generous, and
has spoken highly of my services in his letter. His Majesty
observed that heroism and fidelity appear to be hereditary in
my family; and asked me whether I was not the representative
of the great Prince Pojarsky, the deliverer of Moscow. I answered,
‘Sire, I am his descendant; I know not whether I am
his representative.’ He inquired my meaning, and thus it
came to pass that I talked to him about my father.”</p>

<p>“About your father!” Adrian repeated in great astonishment.
“You amaze me! You and I have lived together for
six years, and never have I heard you so much as name him.”</p>

<p>“No; never to any one around me&mdash;scarcely even to dear
old Petrovitch. Yet to my sovereign, in one hour, the whole
secret of my life flashed out, I know not how. I told all;&mdash;how
ever since I heard the story of my birth in early boyhood,
I dreamed of that exiled father, dwelling forlorn and solitary
in the frozen desert of Siberia; how I longed to seek him out
and comfort him, and even dared to cherish the hope that one
day I might win his pardon and restore him to his home. But,
even as I spoke thus, a sudden overwhelming sense of the
presence in which I stood swept over me. I was confounded,
struck dumb, paralyzed with the sense of my own boldness.
At last I stammered, by way of excuse, ‘I implore of your
Majesty to pardon me; you can understand how the sad fate of
a father must shadow the life of a son!’”</p>

<p>Adrian uttered a groan of dismay. “Most luckless of men!”
he cried. “Never in all your days did you make a blunder
until that moment. My friend Ivan, it is clear you are no
courtier; you may as well give up the game at once and come
back to the camp with me.”</p>

<p>“Why so?” asked Ivan, terribly disconcerted. “What have
I said amiss? I don’t understand&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand! Have you forgotten the fate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
the Czar Paul, and the unfortunate circumstances under which
his majesty began his reign?”</p>

<p>“Utterly!” cried the horror-stricken Ivan, growing red and
pale by turns. “Oh, what have I done?&mdash;I never dreamed of
any sorrow save my own.” But after a long pause he resumed,
with a look of returning composure: “I think he did not
misunderstand me. It is true I saw a look of pain pass
across his face, and I wondered at it for a moment. But his
manner to me grew even gentler than before. He asked me
what my father’s supposed crime had been, and I told him
frankly. Then he said, ‘He shall be sought out and restored
to you, if he be not already beyond our reach;’ and he added,
‘Beyond the reach of God he cannot be. Is it not so?’ I thought
he waited for an answer, and I said, ‘Yes, sire.’ That was
nearly the end. He told me I should receive a communication
to-morrow through the Governor of St. Petersburg, General
Soltikoff. Then I kissed his hand; and the gentleman-in-waiting,
who accompanied me to the gate of the palace, asked for
my address. Now, Adrian, you know as much as I can tell
you. But,” he added to himself, “not <em>all</em>; the look, the
tone, the manner, these are mine, mine only. These it is that
give me the precious sense that I myself&mdash;Ivan Ivanovitch
Pojarsky&mdash;am recognized, thought of, cared for.”</p>

<span class="smcap1 t">The</span> following morning brought Ivan a request, equivalent
of course to a command, that he would wait
upon General Soltikoff. The Governor of St. Petersburg
was a veteran approaching his eightieth year,
and much and deservedly respected both by the sovereign and
by the people. He received Ivan with remarkable courtesy.
Although the ante-chamber was nearly full of persons awaiting
an audience, and some of them were evidently of high rank, he
sent for him almost immediately, and introduced him to his
son and to others who were with him in the cabinet as a young
nobleman who had acted a most heroic part during the Occupation
of Moscow. Then addressing Ivan himself, he said, “The
Emperor has commended you to my particular care. I am
authorized to offer you at present a nomination for the Chevalier
Guard.”</p>

<p>This was a great honour. In this splendid corps every private
was a noble of the highest birth and a Knight of Malta.
Upon state occasions the members formed the monarch’s guard
of honour; they had the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entrée</i> to the receptions at the palace;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
they dined at the imperial table. Their uniform, upon which fabulous
sums were expended, was a mantle of scarlet, with a massive
silver cuirass bearing a large Maltese cross in relief; and the
trappings of their priceless Arabian horses glittered with gold
and jewels. Ivan, knowing all this, remained silent, his face a curious
mixture of intense gratification and extreme embarrassment.</p>

<p>The kind old general beckoned him nearer and spoke in a
lower tone. “I believe I understand your feelings, my young
friend. You are thinking of the expenses the gentlemen of the
Chevalier Guard usually take pride and pleasure in incurring&mdash;of
their armour, their horses, and so forth. Upon that ground
you need hesitate no longer. His Imperial Majesty has requested
me to attend to all your requirements.”</p>

<p>“His goodness overpowers me,” said Ivan with emotion.
“But, my general, that is not my only nor my chief reason for
hesitation.”</p>

<p>“What other can you possibly have? My own grandson
would give one of his eyes to be in your place.”</p>

<p>“My general, Napoleon is near Moscow, and the Chevaliers
of the Imperial Guard are, I believe, in St. Petersburg.”</p>

<p>“So that is your objection! But they have not been there
always, and they are not going to remain there now.”</p>

<p>“Is it not their duty and their honour to remain near the
august person of their sovereign? and that&mdash;”</p>

<p>Soltikoff interrupted him with a smile. “Make your mind
easy, my young friend. The red mantles of the Chevalier
Guard will soon have the opportunity of acquiring a deeper
dye. Already they have received their marching orders, and
in a few days they start for the seat of war. There is barely
time for your equipment and your investiture, if you wish to
go with them.”</p>

<p>“<em>Wish it!</em>” cried Ivan, with kindling eyes. “Whilst Napoleon&mdash;who
has spoiled Moscow and burned the Kremlin&mdash;still
sets his foot upon the soil of holy Russia, I could not support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
life without doing all that one man may do to drive him thence
with infamy.”</p>

<p>“My brave boy, I share your feelings. I could wish myself
two score years younger to take my place amongst the
combatants. Nor is mine,” he added, “the only heart that
throbs with the soldier’s longing. But too gladly would he
who is the highest of all stand this moment in the van of all,
did not the bonds of a sacred duty detain him here.”</p>

<p>“My general,” said Ivan, “I am overcome with gratitude.
The honour of serving my sovereign, in the position he has
assigned me, is beyond my utmost dreams.”</p>

<p>“Then that is settled. Here is my son, who is anxious to
take possession of you. He will introduce you to the Commandant
of the Knights of Malta.”</p>

<p>At a sign from his father, the younger Soltikoff came forward,
and cordially invited Ivan to his house. Seeing him
hesitate for a moment before replying, he said, “Perhaps you
have friends with you?” Ivan mentioned Adrian Wertsch,
who was immediately included in the invitation. He then
remembered Michael, and turning once more towards the general,
craved permission to add a few words. This being readily
granted, he told the mujik’s story; and the poor fellow’s courage
and devotion touched both the Soltikoffs.</p>

<p>“I think,” said the general, “we might put him into the
artillery. He could help to serve a gun. Send him to Colonel
Tourgenieff; my son will give you the address.”</p>

<p>The days that followed were “marked evermore with white”
in the calendar of Ivan Pojarsky. His host introduced him to
the best society of St. Petersburg; he became acquainted with
the Galitzins, the Tolstois, the Narishkins, the Gagarines, and
was welcomed everywhere as a young man who had done much
that was heroic and seen much that was interesting. He was
presented to both the empresses;<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> he attended an imperial reception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
at Kamenoi-Ostrov, offered his humble acknowledgments
to the Czar for his kindness, and had a few gracious words
addressed to him in public, which at once raised to the highest
point his popularity with the great world.</p>

<p>But he could not help observing that this was a world
strangely unlike that which he had known in Moscow before
the war. The reckless extravagance, the heedless gaiety, the
wild dissipation of those days seemed to be no more. Over
many of the noble houses where he visited the angel of death
had already spread his wings,&mdash;a son, a brother, a nephew had
fallen at Smolensko or Borodino; while over all there brooded
the apprehension of the same dread visitation, producing, if not
melancholy, at least seriousness. Ladies of fashion, instead of
playing cards or loto, prepared lint for the wounded or garments
for the perishing. Great efforts were being made for the
relief of the sufferers in the terrible tragedy of Moscow; and
Ivan rejoiced to see immense convoys of clothing and provisions
setting out from the new capital for the old.</p>

<p>Troops of all kinds were coming every day to the city, or
leaving it for the seat of war. Ivan’s friends pointed out to
him, with justifiable pride, the excellent equipment of the soldiers,
and told him of the unwearied exertions of the Czar to
supply the whole of his enormous army not only with the necessaries,
but even with the comforts of life. “Every man in the
service,” it was said, “has his fur pelisse, his warm boots, even
his warm gloves.”<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> Infinite care and pains were expended
upon the commissariat; and depots of all kinds of provisions
were established wherever they were likely to be needed.</p>

<p>In a few days Michael came joyfully to inform “Barrinka”
that he had attained the desire of his heart. “Praised be the
great St. Nicholas!” he said, “I am to be a gunner. My
officer tells me that after a little training I shall be able to pull
a thing they call the lanyard. It makes the gun go off, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
kills the Nyemtzi.” But no earthly happiness is ever without
alloy, and Michael’s was not an exception. There was one
hardship, in his own estimation very serious, to which he had
to submit. “Barrinka,” he asked, “why must our beards be
cut off before we go to fight the Nyemtzi?”</p>

<p>“It has been always done,” said Ivan. “It is the custom.
Besides, do you not know it makes you a free man? The very
hour your beard is cut, you cease to be a serf; you have no
longer any lord on earth except the Czar.”</p>

<p>“I do not care to be a free man,” grumbled Michael; “and
I do not see why I must part with my beard, which God gave
me. It is very hard.”</p>

<p>Ivan laughed. “My dear lad,” he said, “you have given
your hand for our lord the Czar; you are ready to give your
life for him; then why do you grudge him your beard?”</p>

<p>“Do you call it giving to <em>him</em>?” asked Michael. “That
makes a difference certainly. Though I cannot see what the
Czar wants with my beard, still, if it be his Majesty’s pleasure,
he shall have it.”</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards he paid Ivan another visit. Great was
the transformation in his outer man. The cherished beard was
gone; he wore, instead of his caftan, the green uniform of a
gunner; and he was already beginning to acquire the indefinable
but unmistakable air of the trained soldier. “Only think,
Barrinka,” he began eagerly;&mdash;“I am afraid you will not believe
me, but I am ready to swear it is true upon the picture of
my saint. Besides, all the men in our corps heard it, and can
tell you I say nothing but the fact, just as it happened.”</p>

<p>“But you have not yet told me what the fact is. What has
happened to you, Michael?”</p>

<p>“The Czar has spoken to me,” said Michael with beaming
eyes&mdash;“the Czar, his very self.”</p>

<p>“How?&mdash;when?&mdash;what did he say?” cried Ivan, now thoroughly
excited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
“He came to-day to inspect our corps&mdash;‘recruits for the
artillery service,’ we are called. You will not need to be told
that every man of us did his best, and that we made the air
ring with our cheers and ‘houras.’ When the parade was
over, I saw him speaking to our captain, who looked towards
me, and then called me forward. ‘Your Imperial Majesty,’
says he, ‘this is the man.’ ‘Give me your hand, my brave
lad,’ says the Czar, taking in his own this very hand of mine
that you see now. ‘I know how you lost the other, and
I honour your courage and devotion. You have been tried and
found faithful.’ I fell on my knees and kissed the hand that
held mine; which would be honour enough for such as <em>you</em>,
Barrinka, not to speak of a poor mujik like me. Then he said
to all of us, ‘You have done well, my children;’ and we
answered with a shout, ‘Father, we will do better next
time’<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> So he rode away,&mdash;God bless him!&mdash;and the rest
all crowded round me, embraced me, and wished me joy.
Now my one hand, which he has touched, is quite as good as
two.”</p>

<p>Ivan shared the joy of his humble friend. He himself was
beginning to learn some lessons which were new and strange to
him, and which perhaps the miseries he had witnessed and
the sorrows he had experienced had been preparing him to
receive. In the circles where he moved now there was no
longer any scoffing at religion, but rather a devout and reverent
acknowledgment of the hand of God. Most of the nobility
were diligent in their attendance upon the church services; but
some ladies, and a few men of the highest position, were spoken
of in the hearing of Ivan as remarkably pious. Foremost
amongst these were the Princess Metchersky and the Countess
Tolstoi, Prince Alexander Galitzin, and the Sardinian ambassador
De Maistre. No reproach was implied or intended;
their piety seemed to be rather considered as a distinction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
and it was usually added that they stood high in the imperial
favour.</p>

<p>On the last evening of his stay in St. Petersburg, Ivan saw
one of his acquaintances&mdash;a nephew of the Grand-Marshal Tolstoi,
and like himself a member of the Chevalier Guard&mdash;sitting
apart absorbed in a book. The stirring romance of real life
had of late driven all other romances out of the mind of Ivan;
but the sight of an interested reader awakened his slumbering
tastes. He came to the side of Tolstoi&mdash;a gay, good-natured
youth, to whom he could say anything he pleased.
“Is that a new book which you seem to like so much?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I am ashamed to confess it is new to me, or was so until
lately,” returned Tolstoi.</p>

<p>“What is it? A romance? I should think it a kindness if
you would lend it to me when you have done with it yourself.”</p>

<p>“Look at it,” said Tolstoi, placing it in his hand.</p>

<p>It was in French, as Ivan expected; but its appearance was
different from that of any French book he had ever seen before.
Although divided into chapters and verses, it was evidently not
poetry, and very sacred names were of frequent occurrence.
He turned to the opening page, and exclaimed in surprise,
“The New Testament!&mdash;how strange!”</p>

<p>“Why should it be strange?” said Tolstoi simply. “What
better book could I find to read?”</p>

<p>“What is it all about?” asked Ivan. “Of course I know
there are the holy gospels, but this book seems to contain a
great deal besides.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I cannot tell you in a moment. Read it for yourself,
and you will soon learn to love it well.”</p>

<p>Ivan turned back again to the page with which his friend
had been occupied, and which he had kept open with his finger.
He read these words: “Love your enemies, bless them that
curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
that despitefully use you, and persecute you; that ye may be
the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh
his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain
on the just and on the unjust.” “That sort of religion would
never answer!” he exclaimed indignantly, allowing the book
to fall from his hand. “What? <em>Love the French?</em> Do good
to <em>them</em>? Pray for <em>them</em>? I think whoever recommended you,
just now, the reading of this book, must have gone altogether
out of his senses. We should all be ruined if such ideas as
these got abroad amongst us, especially at the present moment,
when it is our supreme duty to hate the enemies of the Czar
and to destroy them.”</p>

<p>“Then how comes it to pass that the Czar himself loves
this book and reads it daily?” asked Tolstoi, as he reverently
took up the volume from the ground.</p>

<p>“I cannot believe that,” said Ivan.</p>

<p>“It is quite true. I heard it from my uncle, who, as you
know, is always about his person. It was that which made me
read it first. Now I love it&mdash;better than any other book in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Since you tell me all this, I will buy a copy, and take it
with me to the camp. Pope Yefim would be pleased if he
knew it. He has sometimes lamented to me that the unlearned
cannot have the Scripture narratives in any tongue they are
able to understand. There is the old Slavonic, of course, but
you might almost as well try to read Babylonish.”</p>

<p>“There is French&mdash;for <em>us</em>,” said Tolstoi; “and I own that
it seems a better thing to me to read the sayings of Christ than
the scoffs of Voltaire.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right,” Ivan answered thoughtfully. After
a pause he added, “Since I have stood alone, like one on a rock
in the midst of a raging sea, with death before me, death
behind me, and death on each side of me, I have sometimes
thought what strength it would give me if only I could look up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
and see a Face bent down on me from above, a Hand outstretched
to help me.”</p>

<p>The next day the Chevalier Guards began their march, and
Ivan with them. Adrian also returned to his duty; and soon
they were in the midst of one of the most memorable campaigns
the world has ever seen.</p>

<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_i.jpg" width="73" height="72" alt="" />
<span class="smcap1 i">It</span> was one of the early days of a genuine Russian
winter. The vast and desolate plain between
Moscow and Smolensko was white with snow;
bitter winds thick with falling flakes were sweeping
over it; and the wintry sun struggled in vain to pierce a
dense frosty fog. A regiment of French infantry, weary,
dispirited, and famishing with hunger, was toiling through the
snow-drifts. Already the ranks were thinned terribly, while
the ghastly faces and shrunken limbs of the survivors told the
story of their sufferings. All the soldier’s pride in his appearance,
in the brightness of his arms, in the trim perfection of
his accoutrements, had vanished long ago; half the disorderly
crowd had thrown away the muskets they were too weak to
carry, nor was a dress to be seen that deserved the name of a
uniform. Any warm garment found amongst the spoils of
Moscow was made to do duty as an overcoat, without regard
to the sex of its original wearer. Our old friend Seppel wore
a lady’s fur-lined dressing-gown, whilst the practical Féron contented
himself with a sheep-skin shuba which had once enveloped
the ample form of a Russian coachman. But no fur was
warm enough to keep the bitter cold of that wintry day from
the weakened frames of men whose only food since leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
Moscow had been a few handfuls of rye soaked in water or a
little horse-flesh.</p>

<p>Clinging to the arm of Féron was a form slight and worn,
and evidently ready to sink with fatigue. “Peste! Mind
what you are about there!” cried Féron sharply, as Henri de
Talmont stumbled and sank to his knees in a snow-drift a little
deeper than usual. Then, pulling him up again by main force
and setting him on his feet&mdash;“Can’t you see where you are
going?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, I cannot see,” answered Henri in a weary voice.
“Féron, you have been very good to me. But it is no use.
You must let me go.”</p>

<p>“I shall do no such thing. Here, my boy, take a pull at
this;” and he put a flask filled with vodka to the lips of his
friend. “Now you can see a little better,” he said with a
laugh, as the stimulant brought a momentary colour to the pale
cheek of Henri. “Can’t you hear too? Listen! there are
wheels coming near us, and horse-hoofs. God grant it may be
stores of some kind, and if so”&mdash;Féron paused a moment and
set his teeth resolutely&mdash;“the Old Guard themselves, with the
Emperor at their head, shall not keep them from us.”</p>

<p>The wheels were already quite close, else under the circumstances
they could not have heard them at all. A carriage
drawn by four horses, and attended by outriders, came dashing
by. It had only one occupant, a general of division, wrapped
from head to foot in rich furs; but every available spot was
crammed with packages and bottles. Some of the men sprang
towards it, and clinging to the back or the sides, begged in
piteous accents for bread, meat, spirits, even a little tobacco&mdash;anything
“Monsieur le Général” would be good enough to spare
them. The coachman and the outriders had to use their whips
pretty freely to get rid of them. It was only surprising that
they did not take what they wanted by force; but either the
lack of courage and mutual understanding, or perhaps some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
remains of military discipline, prevented an outbreak of open
violence.</p>

<p>“Fools for their pains!” said Féron bitterly. “They might
know by this time that the general <em>never</em> has anything to spare
for the soldier. But I am glad he is gone, for the sight of his
luxuries made me mad. May his horses break their knees in
the next snow-drift! Sure to do it before long. That’s one
comfort!”</p>

<p>“And then,” said a comrade, “perhaps we may overtake
him, and get horses, stores, and all. What a supper we should
have!”</p>

<p>“Ay,” observed another, “<em>his</em> horses are very unlike the last
we supped upon. Poor brutes! they were little more than skin
and bone.”</p>

<p>“Féron,” asked a third, “are there no horses in this accursed
country&mdash;no men, no food, no anything?”</p>

<p>“Not much, I suppose, at the best of times. But remember,
my lad, we marched over this very ground ourselves a few
months ago, and wasted and destroyed all we could find.”</p>

<p>It was too true. In this respect they were filled with the
fruit of their own devices; their wanton acts of pillage and
devastation recoiled upon their own heads.</p>

<p>“Féron,” murmured once more the faint voice of Henri, “I
can go no further. I <em>must</em> lie down and rest.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur Henri, if you lie down on that ground, you rise
never more.”</p>

<p>“I know it; but I can bear up no longer. My sight is
gone, my limbs are failing. Dear Féron, let me go.” And in
spite of the sustaining arm of his friend, he staggered and fell.
Féron bent over him, entreating him to rise, and offering his help.</p>

<p>“O Monsieur Henri, think of your mother&mdash;of your sister,
Mademoiselle Clémence. If you hope ever to see their sweet
faces again, rouse yourself, exert all your strength.”</p>

<p>But already Henri seemed half-asleep. A look of rest stole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
over his worn features, and his eyes were closed. Opening
them for a moment, he murmured, “Féron&mdash;my mother&mdash;Clémence.
Ask them to forgive me. Good-bye, dear Féron.
God bless thee!”</p>

<p>The others meanwhile continued their march. In those terrible
days the fall of a comrade scarcely made a Frenchman
turn his head. Seppel called to Féron, “Come along, man!
For what are you lingering?”</p>

<p>To stay behind would be to share the fate of Henri, not to
rescue him. Féron turned sadly away; but after taking two
or three steps, turned back once more, murmuring, “What a
fool I am! No good to him, and a sore loss to me. Still, if
he <em>should</em> awake, even for a moment.” Stooping down, he
slipped his flask of vodka into the benumbed hand of Henri.
“Adieu, comrade,” he said. “If ever I see France again, I will
tell thy mother and Mademoiselle Clémence.”</p>

<p>He rejoined his comrades, and marched on; but as long as it
continued in sight, he could not help looking back, every now
and then, to that black spot in the snow where a comrade had
lain down to die. “Soon enough,” he thought, “it will be
covered with white, and all trace of my poor friend gone for
ever. Perhaps <em>I</em> may be the next&mdash;who knows?”</p>

<p>But at least there was one sufferer unconscious of suffering
now. A feeling of utter peace, of deep content, unknown for
many days, steeped the weary senses of Henri. He seemed to
be sinking into the heart of a profound and dreamless sleep.
Pain and fatigue&mdash;cold and hunger of body&mdash;aching, feverish
unrest of spirit&mdash;all had ceased together. The last sounds that
reached his dulled ear before he passed into unconsciousness
were the words of Féron, “Thy mother and Mademoiselle
Clémence.” And once again those beloved faces drew near&mdash;bent
over him&mdash;glimmered faintly and yet more faintly&mdash;at
last vanished into air. But he did not even know that they
had vanished. All was oblivion now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
Assuredly never again in this world would Henri de Talmont
have awakened, had not a sudden thrill of agony called
him roughly back to life. He started up to wrestle with a
great half-savage wolf-dog, which had fixed its sharp fangs in
his arm. Pain and desperation lent him a momentary strength,
and clenching his hand, he dealt his antagonist a blow between
the eyes that sent it howling away over the snow. Then he
picked up Féron’s flask, and having thanked in his heart that
generous friend, he drank some of its contents, which seemed
to infuse new life into his frame.</p>

<p>Thus strengthened, he rose and stood upon his feet. It was
midnight. The snow had ceased to fall, and the fierce winds
of winter had dropped into utter stillness. Above his head the
moon shone forth from a cloudless sky, and a thousand stars
glittered with frosty brightness. Not a living thing was in
sight, not a tree, not even a stone. Nothing met his gaze but
a broad expanse of stainless white, covering the whole horizon
like a veil of silver. How desolate it looked, yet how fair and
pure! With what bright softness the moonbeams touched the
snow! and how calmly the majestic eyes of those sleepless,
starry watchers looked down from on high, as though they
would say to the toiling, suffering sons of men, “We have seen
ten thousand times ten thousand nights like this since the
making of the world. We know the secret of the Lord. He
means something by every star and every snowflake; and what
he means is very good.”</p>

<p>“He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by
their names.” The words flashed unbidden through the mind
of Henri. He remembered that in this solitude he was not
alone. God was here. He could not turn to God as his friend,
and he <em>knew</em> that he could not. Brought up in a religious
atmosphere, he was all the more distinctly conscious that he
himself was not religious&mdash;that he stood outside some sacred
enclosure Clémence had entered, that he had not something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
which she had. But had it been a stranger or an enemy
whose presence he felt amidst that immense, dreary, aching
solitude, still he would have flung himself at his feet and implored
his help and pity. Surely he might cast himself upon
the God who counted the shining host above his head; surely
that God would look down with pity on the creature his hand had
made, who was “wandering in dumb dismay” over the untrodden
snow. If He would only bring him home, and let him
see his mother’s face again, and ask her forgiveness before he
died!</p>

<p>He knelt down and prayed; if indeed the words were not
a cry of agony rather than a prayer. But they were breathed
into the ear of One who heareth the young ravens when they
cry and the beasts of the forest when they seek their food.
As he rose, he noticed some bright thing glistening in the
moonlight near the spot where he had been lying. He took it
up, and found that it was a tin case containing preserved meat.
No doubt it had belonged to the general of division, and had
fallen out of his carriage as he passed. But to Henri it seemed
the beginning of an answer to his prayer. He ate a portion of
the meat, reserving the rest for future use, and drank a little
more vodka. Thus a degree of animation was restored to his
exhausted system. “Even yet,” he thought, “I may rejoin my
companions.”</p>

<p>There was no wind, yet so intense was the cold that it seemed
to pierce him through and through. He felt as though he were
in a bath of ice. He determined to keep moving, to walk on
straight before him as long as he had strength to do so. He
supposed that he was still upon a road of some kind, because
when he diverged to the right or to the left the snow became
deeper, while if he kept his direct course it did not reach above
his ankles.</p>

<p>Onwards he toiled, and still onwards, weary and footsore,
yet not quite despairing. He knew well that if he yielded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
his ever-increasing fatigue so far as to lie down again, he should
rise no more. It seemed as if years had passed since he parted
with his comrades, a lifetime since he quitted Moscow; and as
to his old happy life in France, <em>that</em> belonged to another and
earlier stage of existence, almost beyond his recollection.</p>

<p>Red rose the sun over the snowy landscape, to sink again,
after the brief wintry day, in clouds of purple and amber.
Once more the stars came out, and still Henri toiled on. But
his strength was well-nigh spent; he was ready to sink from
fatigue, and his little store of meat and vodka had long since
been exhausted. “After all,” he thought, “it is hopeless. As
well die first as last.&mdash;But what is this? Have the stars come
down upon the ground? or whence are those lights I see in the
distance?”</p>

<p>He tried to collect his failing senses and to think. Could
this be a town he was approaching? No; the lights were not
numerous enough. Perhaps it might be a Russian village?
Scarcely; for that the lights seemed too far apart,&mdash;though, even
if it were, he would take his chance and go forward. Better to
fall, like some of his comrades, beneath the axes of the mujiks,
than to perish with cold and hunger in the trackless wilderness.</p>

<p>Suddenly he cried aloud, making his voice ring over the
snow, “Bivouac fires!” A gush of joy, long unknown to
him, filled his heart, bringing with it, from its very intensity,
a kind of momentary pain, as the warmth for which he was
longing would bring a tingling pain to his half-frozen limbs.
“Bivouac fires!” he cried once more, with a glad, weak voice.
“I shall see the faces of my comrades; I shall hear their
voices. Thank God!”</p>

<p>Hope and joy lent new strength to his weary feet. As he
drew nearer to the lights, he saw that the snow was trampled
by footsteps and crushed by wheels. And then the thought
occurred to him, “If these should be our enemies? If I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
find myself in the midst of Russians?” But as the cheerful
blaze of the nearest fire grew clearer and more distinct, and he
saw figures moving around it, fear and hesitation vanished.
He felt nothing but a wild longing to get close to it, which
grew every moment more intense. Running, slipping, staggering
along as best he could, at last he threw himself on the
ground before the fire, in the very midst of the group that
surrounded it.</p>

<p>“Eh! what have we got here?” cried some one with an
oath. The words were French, so much at least was plain to
Henri’s bewildered senses; and at the same time a very savoury
odour reaching his nostrils reminded him that he was famishing
with hunger.</p>

<p>The next moment he was roughly seized and dragged upon
his knees. “What do you want here? You are none of
us. Be off with you, and pretty quick too!” cried a fellow
dressed in a velvet coat which had once belonged to some
Moscow exquisite.</p>

<p>Slowly and stiffly Henri rose to his feet. “Comrades,” he
said with a bewildered air, “it is you who are making a mistake.
I am one of you&mdash;a Frenchman&mdash;a private in the Tenth
Infantry&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hang the Tenth Infantry! It is every man for himself
here. You are not one of our coterie.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> We cannot feed
all the stragglers of the grand army. Begone this instant,
or&mdash;” A push with the butt end of his musket finished the
sentence.</p>

<p>The heartless cruelty of his countrymen filled up the measure
of Henri’s cup of suffering. His spirit was broken. With no
power, with scarcely even a wish to struggle any longer for his
life, he staggered slowly away, intending to lie down in the
nearest snow-drift and die.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
Some one took a blazing brand out of the fire and flung it
after him. “If you want fire, take it!” cried he, and a mocking
laugh rang in the ears of Henri. He turned, and said, “Would
that I had met this night, instead of you Frenchmen, a company
of Russians&mdash;or, still better, a pack of wolves!”</p>

<p>“What is all this about?” asked a deep, hoarse voice, and
a tall figure rose slowly from the opposite side of the fire.</p>

<p>“It is a straggler, a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">polisson</i>, who was trying to join our
coterie. We have just been sending him about his business,”
was the answer.</p>

<p>“What a hurry you were in! Bring him to me,” said the
voice of authority.</p>

<p>There was no need to bring him. Henri himself turned
gladly, though very feebly, towards this new arbiter of his fate.
But when he saw him, he started in surprise. It is true that
part of his uniform was concealed by a long cloak lined with
fur, but his great hairy cap, and his white waistcoat and
gaiters, showed him to be one of the Old Guard, the very <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élite</i>
of the French army. These veterans were objects of envy to
all their fellow-soldiers; for while the rest had been treated
with cruel neglect and indifference, receiving between Moscow
and Smolensko absolutely no rations whatever, the Old Guard
were well and carefully fed, and supplied abundantly with
wine or spirits. The reason was obvious. Upon them devolved
a duty of paramount importance, that of guarding the
person of Napoleon. Therefore, when the bulk of the army,
demoralized by its sufferings, had broken up into fragments,
the Old Guard was still able to keep rank, to present a noble
appearance, and oppose a firm front to the enemy. Hence
the surprise of Henri at finding one of its number amongst
a group of wretched-looking stragglers belonging to various
regiments.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Guardsman surveyed him with a critical eye.
“Why, this is only a slip of a lad, un petit jeune homme,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
said. “He looks half dead already. Mes enfants, he shall
stay with us.”</p>

<p>Faint tones of remonstrance began to make themselves heard,
but they were silenced in a very summary fashion. The
Guardsman laid his bronzed hand, hard as iron, upon the
shoulder of Henri. “Sacre!” he cried. “You shall take him
and me together. Both of us, or neither!”</p>

<p>This was decisive. The poor, abject, half-starved wretches
knew their master; they felt their lives depended upon his
care and guidance; and they obeyed him as, in a time of need,
the incapable usually obey any capable person who undertakes
to direct them. Room was made for Henri beside the fire, and
the very man who had flung the brand after him a few minutes
before now volunteered to chafe one of his ears, which showed
symptoms of being frozen.</p>

<p>Supper was served, consisting of a piece of roasted horse-flesh
without bread or salt, and a very small quantity of rum,
carefully measured out to each member of the party, and mixed
with snow-water. Then every man crept as close to the fire as
he could, wrapped about him what garments he had, and tried
to sleep; every man, that is to say, except the Guard, who,
explaining to Henri that some one must always watch, and
that the first watch of the night devolved upon him, lit his
pipe with a meditative air, and seated himself beside the fire.</p>

<p>Weary as Henri was, he could not help asking one or two
questions. “Garde,” he said, “do you know where we are?”</p>

<p>“Somewhere on the way to Smolensko, which, if we live,
we may reach perhaps in two days or three.”</p>

<p>“Shall we find our regiments again, do you think?”</p>

<p>“I cannot answer for yours, my boy; the new ones seem to
be melting like snow-flakes. The Old Guard,” he added with a
flash of pride, “is always to be found, whether by friend or
foe.”</p>

<p>“These men around us, who are they?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
“Waifs and strays, like yourself. We are gathering together
in coteries of a dozen or so, to try and keep one another
alive in this horrible desert.”</p>

<p>“Little life they would have left in me, but for <em>you</em>, Garde.
God bless you for your kindness.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, comrade. Blessings do a man as little harm as
curses any day. Here, take a pull at my pipe.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you. I don’t smoke.”</p>

<p>“More fool you! That is the way you young conscripts die
off, because you never know what is good for you, nor how to
keep your souls inside your bodies. Now, when I was in
Egypt”&mdash;here he stopped suddenly, and a look of emotion
passed over his bronzed, weather-beaten features&mdash;“ay, Egypt,
Italy, Spain,&mdash;Lodi, Marengo, Austerlitz, Wagram, Friedland,&mdash;why
go over all these now? Why recall the past&mdash;the
glorious past? Why, indeed? Have our eagles floated over
all the world to lie buried in a Russian snow-drift! Bah!
This confusion is only temporary. You shall soon see the
Emperor rise again in his glory, and overwhelm our hounds of
enemies with destruction. I tell thee, boy, he is unconquerable.
A cloud&mdash;a little fleeting cloud&mdash;may pass over his star and
hide it for a moment, but it will shine out again all the more
brightly afterwards.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Henri sadly, “if he expected us to fight for him,
he ought to have fed us.”</p>

<p>“My lad,” said the Guardsman sternly, laying his hand upon
Henri’s shoulder, and turning him round away from the fire,
“you see that snow?”</p>

<p>“I have seen too much of it,” returned Henri. “I think I
shall never see anything else.”</p>

<p>“Out there you go, to have part or lot with us never more,
the first word you speak against the Emperor. With his own
hand he gave me these medals, this cross”&mdash;touching his
breast&mdash;“and, moreover, he said to me once when he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
reviewing us, ‘Pierre Rougeard, I know you for a brave man.
It was you&mdash;was it not?&mdash;who took that pair of colours at
Lodi?’”</p>

<p>“Garde, how were you separated from the rest?”</p>

<p>“You will see to-morrow that I am lame. In a skirmish
near Moscow I got a ball in my leg and a sabre cut on my
shoulder. We who were wounded were all put into waggons
by the Emperor’s orders, to be sent on to Smolensko; but
those in charge of us, thinking our lives less precious than the
plunder they were bringing from Moscow, flung us out by the
wayside to die.”<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>“Wretches! May the Emperor punish them as they
deserve.”</p>

<p>“The Emperor has much more important things to think
about. We of the Old Guard do not die easily; what would
kill conscripts like you, only hardens us. I contrived to live
and to creep along, picking up every day a comrade or two in
distress, until we formed the little coterie you see now. I hope
to overtake the Old Guard at Smolensko&mdash;if not, farther on.
All I live for is to rejoin my colours, and to fight once more
for the Emperor. But you are almost asleep. Sleep on, my
boy; to-night, at least, you shall neither freeze nor starve.”</p>

<p>Henri <em>was</em> almost asleep. But he roused himself for a
moment or two to breathe a thanksgiving to Almighty God
for the help sent him in his need; together with an earnest
prayer that he would be pleased to bring him through all
dangers again to his native land, to see the face of his mother
and of Clémence.</p>

<p>All succeeding generations will ask in half incredulous
wonder how it came to pass that a splendid army, numbering
over six hundred thousand men, and commanded by perhaps
the greatest military genius that ever existed, could fall so
suddenly and swiftly into a state of utter disorganization and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
abject misery. Certainly never, since those ancient days when
the Red Sea rolled over the hosts of Pharaoh, or the angel of
the pestilence smote the sleeping myriads of Sennacherib, was
the arm of the Lord stretched out more visibly in the sight of
the nations. Yet it is the glory of Infinite Wisdom, not to
interpose amongst the wheels of human action with arbitrary
breaks and changes, but so to direct the whole stupendous
machine that wrong works out its own punishment and right its
ultimate justification by the operation of everlasting laws. In
gaining Moscow, Napoleon expected to gain everything&mdash;food
and shelter for his troops, stores of all descriptions, treasures
enough to satisfy the greed of those soldiers of fortune
whom the hope of plunder had attracted to his standards.
He expected to dictate a humiliating peace to the crushed
and trembling Czar, and to make yet one more submissive
tributary of hitherto unconquered Russia. But in the flames
of Moscow and the heroic resolution of Alexander he found
the destruction of his plans. Retreat became a necessity; and
it had to be made through a country already devastated by
the license of his armies&mdash;license for which he made himself
responsible, which indeed he forced upon them, by neglecting
to provide them with the necessaries of life. This cruel neglect
recoiled upon his own head: even before the severities of a
northern winter set in<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> the hosts of Napoleon were <em>perishing
with hunger</em>. “If he expected us to fight for him, he ought to
have fed us,” was the mournful accusation that fell from the
dying lips of many a gallant soldier, who, faithful to the
end, would allow himself to utter no other reproach. What
famine and pestilence&mdash;the result of insufficient and unwholesome
food&mdash;had begun, was completed by the arrows of the
winter in the hand of God himself. As, on the occasion of
another memorable national deliverance, “he blew with his
wind,” and the foes of his people were scattered; so now he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
cast forth his ice like morsels, and who was able to abide his
frost? Snow and vapour and stormy wind fulfilled his word.
Of the six hundred thousand warriors who crossed the Niemen
in the pride of their strength, only about forty thousand
miserable fugitives&mdash;diseased, forlorn, and famished&mdash;straggled
back again five months later.</p>

<span class="smcap1 r">Rougeard</span> and his companions succeeded in
reaching Smolensko, but only to find it a scene
of intolerable wretchedness and unutterable confusion.
The Emperor and the Old Guard had
left some days previously, and for the disorganized troops
pouring every hour into the miserable, ruined city, there was
neither food nor shelter, neither order nor discipline. So our
little coterie still kept together, and hoping against hope
determined to continue their march towards the frontier.</p>

<p>Ten or twelve weary days of marching followed. Always
hungry, always cold, always tired, Henri would have given up
the struggle once and again, but for the thought which kept
for ever</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Beating in upon his weary brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though it were the burden of a song”&mdash;<br /></span>

<p class="in0">“I must see my mother and my sister again; I cannot die
without my mother’s forgiveness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
Usually their only food was a little horse-flesh, but even that
failed them frequently; nor could fuel be always found for the
fire of their bivouac. From the bodies of their comrades that
strewed the way they sometimes obtained articles of clothing&mdash;a
sad resource, but all, even the gentle Henri, were now becoming
inured to sights of horror. Sometimes they would meet
with other coteries whose condition was as pitiable as their
own, or they would be alarmed by a few stray shots from the
“clouds of Cossacks” that hovered about them. Rougeard
informed them that the enemy was <em>beside</em>, not <em>behind</em> them;
the Russians having very prudently chosen their lines of march
parallel to that of the retreating French armies, which were
thus kept from straying to the right or to the left, and sternly
restricted to the track their own cruelty had already rendered
a desert.</p>

<p>At last a serious misfortune happened to the little band. A
long day’s march, absolutely without food and in piercing cold,
had exhausted them all. Rougeard, who was by far the
strongest of the party, said to his companions, “Rest in the
shelter of this wall, while I go a little further towards the
lights I see yonder. I daresay some of our people are there;
perhaps they will respect my uniform, and spare us a little
food.” He moved away, but turned back for a moment to
add, “Keep up your hearts, my lads. If your strength is good
for one day’s marching more, I think you may see the Beresina
before to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>That was the last time they looked upon the face or heard
the voice of Pierre Rougeard. Whether he was buried in the
snow, was murdered or made prisoner by the Russians, they
could not tell. His loss dissolved the coterie which his influence
had held together. Its members went their several
ways, and far too sad a task would it be for us to follow them.
Each in his own measure fulfilled the awful doom that had
fallen upon the host to which he belonged. For the word had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
gone forth: “Thus saith the Lord, Such as are for death, to
death; such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as
are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the
captivity, to the captivity.”</p>

<p>We may, however, follow for a little way the fortunes of
Rougeard. The bivouac fires he saw at a distance proved to
be those of a Russian regiment of volunteers. He fell into
the hands of the sentries, and in spite of a resistance as desperate
as his exhausted condition permitted him to make, was
secured, and brought at once to the colonel, a Russian nobleman
named Demidoff. To his questions Rougeard replied with
proud fearlessness; but he owned, upon being asked, that he
was famishing with hunger. Demidoff, who perhaps had been
reading the Book his sovereign loved so well, led the prisoner
to his own tent, where an elegant and abundant dinner had
just been served. “Sit down, my friend,” he said to him, “eat
and drink; you are welcome.”</p>

<p>But the veteran did not obey. His brave, proud heart,
which no peril of field or flood or wilderness had ever daunted,
was melted, was crushed by the unexpected kindness. A great
shudder passed over his frame. Trembling “as certainly he
never would have trembled before the enemy,” he said with
uncontrollable emotion, “Can it be that a Russian, an officer,
bids me sit down to eat and drink with him, after all the
horrors we have committed in his country, and against his
Emperor?”<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>But it could not be expected that all Russians would take their
revenge after the manner of Demidoff. Many of the mujiks,
who had been insulted and plundered, or had seen their relatives
murdered by the French, put the prisoners that fell into their
hands to a cruel death. Fortunately, reports of these outrages
soon reached St. Petersburg, and a ukase was despatched immediately
by the hand of a special courier, forbidding all such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
practices on pain of the Czar’s highest displeasure; and, as the
most effectual mode of preventing them, offering the reward of
a ducat of gold for every prisoner brought safely to head-quarters.</p>

<p>Henri de Talmont bore in mind Rougeard’s parting words,
and determined at all hazards to try to reach the Beresina.
He was strengthened in his belief that he was drawing near
some point of general rendezvous by the constantly increasing
crowds. At length, instead of a vast and solitary plain, he
found himself traversing a broad high-road, frozen hard, and
thronged with a disorderly rabble of soldiers and camp-followers,
amongst whom vehicles of all kinds were moving with difficulty.
Some of these were baggage-waggons, but the great majority
contained women and children connected in various ways with
the French army, and endeavouring with it to make their
escape from a hostile country. Most pitiable was the fate of
those unhappy fugitives.</p>

<p>As Henri stumbled wearily along, the velvet cap of a little
child dropped from one of the carriages and fell at his feet. He
picked it up and restored it to its owner, a pretty fair-haired
boy about four years old.</p>

<p>“Thank you, poor soldier,” lisped the child in soft Italian,
a language of which Henri had learned a little from his
mother.</p>

<p>“I think, Guido, we could make room for the poor soldier
here,” said the child’s mother, a gentle-looking lady with an
infant in her arms; “he seems very tired.”</p>

<p>Most thankfully did Henri accept the proffered help. He
soon ascertained that the lady was an Italian singer who had
come to Russia, with the band of professional artists to which
she belonged, in the train of the fantastic and pomp-loving
King of Naples. These poor children of pleasure, dragged unawares
into the midst of a horrible tragedy, seemed like butterflies
caught in a thunderstorm. Madame Leone told Henri,
with many tears, that her husband had been made prisoner by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
the Cossacks, and that she knew not whether he was alive or
dead. Henri tried to console her, helped her to take care of
the children, and defended her as well as he could from the
rude assaults of the famishing soldiers who surrounded the
carriage, begging for food, or rather demanding it.</p>

<p>At last they reached the bank of the Beresina, but it was
to find themselves in the midst of untold confusion and unutterable
horror. The frozen marsh beside the river was thronged
with an innumerable crowd, increasing in density as it neared
the heads of the two bridges which had been thrown across the
current. Hundreds of vehicles were there, vainly attempting
to force a passage through the living mass. Oaths and shrieks,
cries, groans, and entreaties resounded upon every side. To
add to the terrors of the scene, the Russians were pouring a
continuous fire upon the troops which were endeavouring to cross
the river.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this bewildering, maddening confusion,
Henri found himself thinking dreamily of his mother’s stories
of the terrible passage of the Loire by the defeated Vendéans.
“It was like the day of judgment,” she used to say. “And
what,” asked Henri, “would she have thought of <em>this</em>?”</p>

<p>He was startled by a voice near him. “Monsieur Henri, is
it you? Is it really you?” cried some one in the crowd, seizing
his hand and grasping it. “This is indeed a miracle.”</p>

<p>“Féron! dear Féron!” exclaimed Henri, springing from his
seat in the carriage and throwing himself into the arms of his
comrade.</p>

<p>Questions and explanations followed, and each told the other
his adventures since they parted.</p>

<p>“Where is our regiment?” asked Henri.</p>

<p>“It has ceased to exist,” returned Féron. “‘Sauve qui
peut’ is our only marching order now.”</p>

<p>“Ah, friend,” said Henri, “I see you have suffered. Your
hand&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
“Frost-bitten one bitter night. I could not help thinking
when I lost it of that poor Russian whom we branded in the
hand before we came to Moscow. Do you remember him,
Monsieur Henri?”</p>

<p>“I ought to remember him. I saw him again in the city,
and he did me a good turn.&mdash;Now, Féron, I want you, if you
can, to help me to protect this lady and these two helpless
little children.”</p>

<p>“<em>If</em> I can. But we must be patient. Those who are rushing
madly forward to try and reach the bridge only increase
their own danger. Already they are trampling one another
down by dozens.”</p>

<p>“Ay,” said Henri, “because they are afraid the bridges will
be burned or broken as soon as the effective troops have passed
over them, to protect the retreat of the Emperor.”</p>

<p>“Fools! Do they think the Emperor will let the bridges
be touched so long as one Frenchman or Frenchwoman remains
upon this side? They do not know him,” returned Féron.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” said Henri sadly. “Ah, what is this?” he
cried the next moment, as a bullet whizzed close by them
through the air.</p>

<p>“I believe our rear-guard and the Russians are fighting it
out, and we are near enough to come in for a stray shot or
two.”</p>

<p>“Then help me to turn this carriage over, that we may
make a shelter for the lady.”</p>

<p>This was accomplished, not without some difficulty. Anxious
hours of suspense and forced inactivity followed. Night fell,
but an awful light still illumined the landscape. What looked
like a semicircle of flame environed half the sky. It was the
fiery breath of the Russian cannon.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a sound of fearful shrieks, and a frantic
swaying and tossing of the crowd. One of the bridges&mdash;that constructed
for the artillery&mdash;had broken down, precipitating its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
living freight into the freezing waters beneath; and the miserable
multitude on the bank, who were suffering more and
more from the cannonade of the enemy, now rushed forward in
blind terror to gain the only remaining bridge.</p>

<p>Henri lost sight of Madame Leone and the baby in the press,
and it was with difficulty that he saved little Guido from being
trodden under foot, by holding him continually in his arms.</p>

<p>Féron kept by his side throughout. At last, however, he cried
aloud suddenly, “Comrade, I am done for! That bullet&mdash;”</p>

<p>Henri saw it was too true. In great distress he knelt down
beside him and tried to stanch the blood that was flowing from
his breast.</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment a company of the rear-guard
came thundering by, forcing their way through the living mass,
and cutting down without remorse or pity all who obstructed
their retreat.</p>

<p>“Time to go <em>now</em>,” said Féron with an effort. “Monsieur
Henri, don’t stay for me. I thought <em>I</em> would have brought
home news of you; now <em>you</em>&mdash;but go, I entreat of you, go at
once. No time to lose.”</p>

<p>“Never, while <em>you</em> breathe. Besides, as you said, the Emperor
will not leave a Frenchman behind him.” Recollecting
that Madame Leone had filled with wine the flask Féron himself
had left with him, he mixed some of its contents with
snow-water, and put the reviving draught to the lips of his
comrade.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Henri,” murmured Féron, “can you say a prayer
for me? You used to pray, though we laughed at you for it
in the regiment.”</p>

<p>“There is one prayer I have often prayed since all this
trouble came upon us,” said Henri. “It is good, and it is short;
you can say it for yourself&mdash;‘God be merciful to me a sinner,
for Jesus Christ’s sake.’”</p>

<p>“God be merciful to me a sinner, for Jesus Christ’s sake,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
Féron repeated earnestly; and during the hour that followed&mdash;an
hour that seemed like a year to Henri&mdash;the cry was often
on his lips.</p>

<p>But he grew weaker and weaker, until at last he fell into a
kind of stupor, while Henri watched silently beside him.</p>

<p>Just about the dawning of the day, a cry, great and terrible,
thrilled every heart, and reached even the dulled ear of the
dying man. He roused himself, and murmured faintly, “What
is it, Monsieur Henri?”</p>

<p>Henri knew too well. All around him were repeating, in
tones that expressed every variation of anguish and despair&mdash;“The
bridge is on fire! the bridge is burning!” So, after all,
Napoleon had <em>not</em> waited until every Frenchman was safe on
the other side!</p>

<p>“‘The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth
not for the sheep,’” thought Henri bitterly. “But <em>thou</em> shalt
never know, Féron. This pang at least shall be spared thy
dying hour.”</p>

<p>He bent once more over his friend, who was feebly repeating
the question&mdash;“Monsieur Henri, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing that concerns you or me,” Henri answered firmly.
“Do you suffer, comrade?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no pain. Only I am sinking&mdash;sinking. I want to
say that prayer again. God be merciful&mdash;for Christ’s sake.”</p>

<p>With these words on his lips, Féron passed away. Henri
had scarcely time to close his eyes before he was forced by the
strong current of the crowd from the spot where he had been
standing. He kept fast hold of Guido: just now he cared
but little what became of himself; his only thought was to
save the child. He was at last pushed into a position from
which he could see the river; but he turned shuddering from
the sight, which indeed was horrible beyond description. Men,
women, and children were struggling in the icy waters, or sinking
for the last time beneath them. Here and there a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
swimmer gained the opposite bank in safety; but the weak,
the famished, the wounded perished by hundreds. Pieces of
the broken bridge, to which drowning wretches were clinging,
floated about amidst <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débris</i> of every conceivable kind; and
those on board the few sorely overcrowded boats were violently
thrusting away their despairing comrades who tried to enter.</p>

<p>One of these boats was just putting off from the bank when
Henri called aloud, “Take this child with you, for God’s
sake!”</p>

<p>A tall man stood upright in the boat. “Hold him up,
man,” he cried; “give us a sight of him.”</p>

<p>Henri did so.</p>

<p>“The very child we are seeking&mdash;eh, comrades?” said the
man, turning to his companions. “About three or four years
old, fair-haired, with a crimson velvet cap. Well worth our
while&mdash;a thousand ducats reward.” Then to Henri: “Throw
him in, my lad.”</p>

<p>This was much more easily said than done. Little Guido
clung to his protector with all his might, absolutely refusing to
be separated from him. Henri found it impossible to unclasp
those soft arms from about his neck, though he tried hard to
do it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the men in the boat were disputing with one
another. Some were willing to take Henri as well as the child;
others objected, afraid of losing the reward or of having to
share it with him. But the tall man who had spoken first
decided the question. “Let the lad come with us,” he said.
“Anything to save time.”</p>

<p>So Henri stepped into the boat with his little companion
still in his arms. It did not occur to him until afterwards that
Madame Leone would have been by no means able to offer a
reward so large as a thousand ducats for the recovery of her
child. Happily during the crossing Guido engrossed all his attention.
Terrified by everything around him, he cried violently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
for his mother, and refused to be comforted; so that a child’s
tears drew away the eyes of Henri from the agonized faces of
strong men, who were looking up to Heaven with their last
appeal for mercy ere they sank to rise no more.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the boat touched the opposite bank of the
stream, when a lady ran down to meet it, and stretched out
her arms to receive the boy. But the next moment a cry of
bitter disappointment rang through the air. This was not <em>her</em>
child&mdash;not the darling for whose recovery she had offered all
her golden store. The broken-hearted mother turned away,
and Henri saw her no more. Still holding Guido in his arms,
he followed listlessly and mechanically the stream of fugitives
who were taking the road to Vilna.</p>

<span class="smcap1 t">The</span> miserable fugitives who succeeded, at the cost of
so much suffering, in crossing the icy waters of the
Beresina, found no “promised land” on the other
side. Better had it been if with one accord they had
laid down their arms on the banks of that fatal river, and surrendered
to the mercy of the enemy. The horrors that awaited
them well-nigh cast into oblivion those they had already passed
through, and filled to absolute overflowing the cup of trembling
put into their hands. Until then the cold had not exceeded
that of the ordinary winter of those regions; but during that
terrible month of December it grew ever more and more intense,
until it reached a pitch of severity almost beyond precedent.
A silent, invisible, invincible enemy, it mowed down
the ranks of strong men with a pitiless scythe, sparing neither
the young recruit nor the hardened veteran who had passed
unscathed through all the sufferings of the preceding campaign.</p>

<p>Henri de Talmont was at first only conscious of one definite
purpose, that of keeping his little charge from perishing with
cold. If he could but bring him alive to Vilna, perhaps he
might find Madame Leone there and restore him to her. Seeing
that a crowd had gathered about a carriage which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
overturned, and which they were plundering of its contents, he
joined it in the hope of obtaining some provisions for the way.
With more consideration for Guido’s tastes than for his own,
he seized eagerly upon a small bag of sugar and a box of chocolate
bonbons. He afterwards made use of the chocolate as a
bribe to induce the little one to run along by his side, for he
was scarcely strong enough to carry him. But the poor little
fellow was unable to endure the piercing cold, and cried piteously
to be taken up again in his arms. Weak though he was
himself, Henri could not resist the appeal; but it hastened the
inevitable moment when, utterly overcome with fatigue, he was
fain to lie down and rest, even at the risk of rising again no
more.</p>

<p>So many broken and abandoned properties of all kinds
strewed the way that it was not difficult to contrive a sort of
shelter for the night. A disabled gun-carriage and a couple of
cloaks served Henri as a tent for himself and Guido, whom he
folded to his breast as warmly as he could, and both were soon
fast asleep.</p>

<p>The intense, biting chill that preceded the dawn awakened
Henri. “My poor little Guido is very cold,” he thought; “I
must wrap him up better;” and he took the coverings from
himself to fold them more closely about his charge. The child
did not waken, nor even stir; nor did any increase of external
warmth remove the icy chill from those little limbs. Henri
grew alarmed, and thought at last that he ought to awaken
him and give him some nourishment. But all his efforts were
in vain. That wintry night Christ had called a little child to
come to him from the frozen plain. Gentle was the call and
silent the response,&mdash;the young spirit passed away in sleep,
without struggle and without suffering.</p>

<p>Black despair fell upon Henri then. There seemed no use
in making any further struggle for life. All around him
were dead or dying; all whom he had known during the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
agony of the retreat from Moscow had yielded to their doom.
Féron was dead&mdash;Rougeard was dead, as he believed&mdash;the dying
face of many another comrade rose before him&mdash;and now, this
child. How was he better than they?</p>

<p>Before he lay down to sleep he had prayed for himself and
for Guido. The little one also had clasped his baby hands and
lisped in his soft Italian a prayer that they might find his
mother on the morrow. But beside that still, fair form&mdash;almost
as white as the snow around it, and consecrated with the
twofold beauty of childhood and of death&mdash;Henri breathed no
prayer. Not then, nor for many days afterwards. It was no
use, he said in his heart.</p>

<p>Still he wandered on&mdash;in cold, in hunger, in weariness.
Hope was gone, memory had almost left him; nothing remained
but that desperate clinging to life, which is scarcely
more than the instinct of an animal. The path he had to
follow was strewn with the dead bodies of his comrades; and
upon these he sometimes found a little bread, or a small
quantity of wine or spirits. On more than one occasion he
warmed his freezing limbs by crouching beneath the corpse
of a fellow-sufferer in whom the vital spark was only just
extinct. He could not have survived at all but for the
sugar and the chocolate that he had obtained for Guido.
These, though he knew it not, afforded precisely the kind of
nutriment best adapted to sustain life under intense cold.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>He was seldom conscious of any sensations but those of
the body. He was always cold, always hungry, always in
pain; only sometimes this never-ceasing, never-ending sense of
pain was lightened by a kind of dull satisfaction, as when he
found food, or slept, or felt a little warmer than usual. Occasionally
a comrade would hail him, and inquire his name
and whither he was going. Henri hardly knew what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
answered. Sometimes he would talk incoherently; at other
times he would reply correctly enough&mdash;say he was going to
Vilna&mdash;and in his turn ask questions about the road. He
noticed that some of those whom he met stared at him vacantly,
or with the fierce glare of insanity; when he spoke they would
give him wild and wandering answers, or perhaps even
threaten him with violence. Once a miserable being, looking
like a spectre, stood and gazed at him in silence, until he
asked him what he wanted. “Nothing,” answered he, with a
strange, sad smile,&mdash;“nothing; I am a dead man.”<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p>There were moments, perhaps hours, when Henri’s crushed
intelligence seemed to revive, and he regained the power of
thought and feeling. But these seasons were the most terrible
of all. His soul was fast bound in misery and iron. It was
hard with despair as the ground beneath his feet with the frost
of winter. If he thought of his mother&mdash;he “would never
see her again; and what did it matter? She had never forgiven&mdash;never
would forgive him now.” Of Clémence&mdash;“she
was so good! She would be very happy in her religion, in her
pious books, in her good works. No doubt she was happy
enough even now, though her one brother was dying miserably
of cold and hunger by the side of a Polish road. Clémence
would only say, ‘It is the will of God.’”</p>

<p>The will of God! That was the bitterest thought of all.
His will was inexorable. There was no use in prayer. Henri
had tried prayer, and had not been heard. God did not
care for him. He sat on his throne, far above yonder cold,
gray, pitiless wintry sky,&mdash;as cold, and yet more pitiless.
This was his hand, his vengeance; by his inscrutable decree
half a million of men were dying in torture, because he was
angry with Napoleon Buonaparte.</p>

<p>Sometimes he thought it was not his will, but only a terrible
chance. Sometimes it seemed easier to believe, with most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
his comrades, that there was no God, no Being who shaped the
destinies of the human race. Practically, at least, there was
none for him; none to whom it mattered whether he lived or
died. Then the whole subject would pass from him and be
forgotten in the absorbing interest of his quest for food. Something
to allay the pangs of hunger had to be sought for, very
much as the wild beast seeks for its prey.</p>

<p>How long this dreary life in death continued Henri never
knew. But it had an end at last, like all suffering on this side
of the grave. One day he found himself in what was evidently
the melancholy and abandoned ruin of a once beautiful pleasure-ground.
The pitiless frost had done its part to blight and to
destroy; but the yet more pitiless hand of man had left its
deeper traces. A castle, once fit for a royal residence, but now
dismantled and partly burned, completed the picture of desolation.</p>

<p>All at once, as revealed by a lightning flash, Henri recalled
the past. Could this indeed be Zakret&mdash;the splendid summer
residence, with beautiful gardens, which the Czar had purchased
just before the war? Only six months had passed since Henri
wandered with genuine pleasure amidst its shady walks, and
admired its magnificent conservatories filled with rare exotics,
its terraces gay with the bloom of a thousand summer flowers.
He even remembered the exasperation he had felt at the conduct
of his fellow-soldiers, who wasted all that wealth of beauty
with reckless, malicious hands, because it belonged to their
enemy the Czar. “He is well avenged,” thought Henri.
“We did not dream that he would have proved himself so
strong.”</p>

<p>Another thought came then. Zakret was close to Vilna, the
goal for the present of his weary wanderings. The idea lent
his worn frame a momentary strength; he would get up, and
go there immediately. He had thrown himself upon a seat&mdash;some
broken masonry belonging to what had once been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
beautiful fountain&mdash;but now he rose quickly, and tried to walk.
But the effort proved too much for him; he tottered, slipped
upon the frozen ground, fell, and utterly lost consciousness.</p>

<p>When he recovered from his long and death-like swoon, he
found everything changed around him. Instead of the wintry
sky, he saw above him a lofty vaulted roof. The light was
dim, but sufficient to reveal the scene. The floor was covered,
or rather crowded with prostrate forms; in some places they
lay in heaps. He stretched out his hand, and touched the
form nearest him; it was cold as ice, and in his horror at the
thought that he was surrounded by the dead, he uttered a
weak, agonized cry.</p>

<p>Several heads were raised at this, and eyes, bright with fever
or dim with the mists of approaching death, gazed at him in a
kind of dull surprise.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” he asked feebly.</p>

<p>Some one dressed in a ragged French uniform, and carrying a
large pitcher filled with snow, approached the place where he
lay. “In prison,” he said. “They brought you in a while
ago with some other sick men.”</p>

<p>“Are you a warder?” pursued Henri.</p>

<p>“You insult me! Can’t you see my uniform? I am, like
yourself, a prisoner and a Frenchman. But those of us who
are still passably strong are allowed to go down to the court
and gather snow for the rest.”</p>

<p>He was prevented from adding more by the clamour of the
sick men around. All who were able to speak begged in
piteous accents for a portion of the snow, holding out cups and
other small vessels to receive it.</p>

<p>Henri was more conscious at the moment of hunger than
of thirst. “Is there any food?” he asked in a faint
voice.</p>

<p>A piece of hard biscuit was pushed towards him, and he took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
it eagerly. Then half-a-dozen hands were extended, and as
many voices spoke to him&mdash;“Take my biscuit, and give me in
exchange your next cup of snow-water.”</p>

<p>Henri ate a little, moistening his biscuit with the snow-water;
but bitter experience had taught him moderation.
Then, forgetting that he was no longer a famished fugitive
fighting for the necessaries of life, he began, from habit, to conceal
the remainder about his person.</p>

<p>A harsh, bitter laugh, from the man who brought in the
snow, made him look up. “No need to hide what nobody
wants,” said he. “Biscuit is the only thing we have in plenty
here&mdash;except death.”</p>

<p>“Can this indeed be Vilna?” Henri asked with a bewildered
look.</p>

<p>His informant nodded.</p>

<p>“Then where is the army&mdash;the Emperor? How comes it
that we are prisoners?”</p>

<p>“The army?&mdash;gone like the snow I brought in just now.
The Emperor?&mdash;safe in Paris by this time. If it will be a
comfort to you in your dying moments to know that his
Imperial Majesty ‘never was better in all his life,’ I have the
satisfaction of affording it. He announced the fact in his last
bulletin.”</p>

<p>Henri stirred uneasily, and cast a mournful glance around
him. All that met his senses was foul and loathsome in the
extreme. The atmosphere of the place was “at once icy and
pestilential;” and the whole, the sick, the dying, and the dead,
lay heaped together promiscuously. Dead bodies, or mutilated
portions of them, were piled together in the windows, a ghastly
defence against the bitter wintry wind; while every noxious
odour, every hideous and revolting sight that accompanies
disease and death, filled the vaults and corridors of the
spacious building, making it one vast and dreary charnel-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
“This is horrible!” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Nothing could be worse. No beds&mdash;no straw even&mdash;no
fire, no wine, no medicine&mdash;nothing but rations of hard biscuit,
and the snow we can find for ourselves in the court.”</p>

<p>“The Russians, since we are their prisoners, ought to treat
us with more humanity,” said Henri.</p>

<p>“The Russians, my boy, have as much as they can do to
take care of their own sick and wounded. As for us, hundreds
of famished wretches are brought in here every day, until
there is no more room in which to lay them down to die. This
building which is now our prison, the Convent of St. Basil,
will soon be our grave. That is one comfort. Our miseries
will be quickly ended. The hospital fever has broken out.”</p>

<p>“Typhus fever?” said Henri with a look of horror.</p>

<p>“Even so; we are dying fast. Every day we have to
carry out the dead bodies, or to throw them from the
windows.”</p>

<p>“Are there no physicians?”</p>

<p>“Physicians? What should bring them <em>here</em>? It is death
to enter these doors. Not the very Poles themselves, who
were so loud in their acclamations when we came here six
months ago&mdash;who called us their brothers, their deliverers&mdash;would
dare to bring us now so much as a cup of cold water.
Even the guards die who are stationed to watch us. We shall
soon be left unguarded. Then we may go out free if we like&mdash;only
none of us will be alive to go.”</p>

<p>Henri covered his face. He was utterly crushed. He seemed
no longer to feel, to care for anything&mdash;a numb chill despair
lay like a weight of lead upon his heart.</p>

<p>After what might have been, for aught he knew, a considerable
time, he was aroused from his stupor by the sound of voices,
and interested, in spite of himself, by what reached his ear.
Some one was pleading earnestly with another in the accents of
a soft musical tongue, which at first he took for Italian, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
Guido’s, but he soon found that he could not understand the
words spoken. However, the speakers presently relapsed into
French, and then he easily gathered that one of them, a
Spaniard, dying of the cruel hospital fever, was entreating his
French comrade to write for him a letter of farewell to his wife.
Evidently the feelings of the Frenchman were touched. Henri
saw him tear a leaf from a book which he had with him, and
write upon it at the dictation of the Spaniard, and in his
language. “Though where is the use?” he heard him say to
one near him in a lower tone. “Poor fellow! there is none to
send it for him.”</p>

<p>By-and-by another pitcher of snow was brought in by Henri’s
first acquaintance, whose name was Pontet.</p>

<p>When with some difficulty he had distributed the coveted
refreshment among its many eager and agonized claimants, he
said briefly, as he set down his pitcher, “I have news.”</p>

<p>Heads were raised and eyes were turned towards him, but
for the most part languidly; suffering had well-nigh killed
desire and hope&mdash;even fear was scarcely felt.</p>

<p>“The Emperor is come,” said Pontet. In that word there
was a spell potent enough to arouse the dying. On every
side exclamations arose&mdash;“Come back! Retaken the town!
Stolen a march upon them all! Ah, what joy! What a
triumph!” and one voice, weak but courageous, raised the old
well-remembered cry, “Vive Napoléon!”</p>

<p>“Hush, you fools!” said Pontet sharply. “Napoleon is far
enough away. Do you think there is no other Emperor in the
world? I am speaking of the Emperor Alexander.”</p>

<p>Bitter was the disappointment, especially to dying hearts.
Pontet came in for sundry curses, feeble but emphatic, and one
sick man flung his cup at him. “How dare you raise our
hopes only to dash them so cruelly?” he cried.</p>

<p>“I had more to tell,” Pontet continued; “but if you care
not to listen, I can spare my breath.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
“Tell us, friend, tell us,” spoke two or three voices together.</p>

<p>“I have made a friend amongst the guards who knows a little
French, and is disposed to be communicative. He says the
Czar has appointed General St. Priest governor and guardian
of all the prisoners.”</p>

<p>“St. Priest!&mdash;Who is he?”</p>

<p>“A Frenchman in the service of Russia. <em>Because</em> he is a
Frenchman this office has been given him. My comrades, this
looks well.”</p>

<p>“Nothing looks well now but the grave,” said the man who
cried “Vive Napoléon.”</p>

<p>“Pontet,” he continued, “I don’t think much of your news.
St. Priest may be a Frenchman, but then he must be a pretty
rascal, to fight against France.”</p>

<p>“Well, we shall see.”</p>

<p>“What is that noise?” asked Henri, as the loud rattling of
an iron chain was heard.</p>

<p>“They are only swinging the great lamp up to its place,
where it hangs from the roof. How early they are lighting it
to-night! It will be daylight in the court for another hour.”</p>

<p>After this Henri fell into a troubled, uneasy sleep. When
he awoke, there was a general stir around him, and a murmur
of suppressed excitement. “What is the matter?” he
asked of Pontet, who was sitting near him, resting his head on
his hand.</p>

<p>He looked up to answer the question. “The guards say
Monsieur de St. Priest is coming to visit us.”</p>

<p>“He must be a brave man,” said Henri.</p>

<p>“Ay de mi!” murmured the Spaniard. “If I <em>dare</em> but ask
him to send that letter! Ah, Teresa mia!” Tears stole into
his dying eyes as that beloved face arose before him in its dark,
well-remembered beauty; and once more his little children
seemed to climb about his knees, while the orange-tree beside
his cottage door shed its fragrant blossoms over him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
“Hush!” said those around&mdash;“hush! here comes Monsieur
le Général.”</p>

<p>St. Priest came slowly, threading his way through the thick
ranks of sick men stretched upon the ground. His look was
absorbed and anxious; some great care seemed to oppress him.
Pontet whispered, “See how he is leaving the work to his
aide-de-camp.”</p>

<p>For all observed that the companion of St. Priest paused
continually, and, bending low over the sufferers, spoke in turn
to each, patiently waiting for an answer. Those near him noticed
also with surprise that Frenchmen, Poles, and Germans
were addressed with equal fluency, each in his own tongue.</p>

<p>As he approached, the good-natured Frenchman who had
written the Spaniard’s letter for him whispered, “Try the aide-de-camp.
He looks kind.”</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, the dying man stretched out his worn and
fevered hand. “For the love of God, Monsieur l’Aide de
camp,” he prayed in his broken French, “take this letter and
send it for me. It is my last farewell to my dear wife.”</p>

<p>“That letter shall reach its destination,” was the answer,
uttered in a tone of deep feeling; and stooping over the prostrate
form, the speaker added some gentle words of hope and
consolation.</p>

<p>As his tall figure resumed its erect position, the lamplight
shone upon his face, revealing it to Henri. It was a noble,
refined, sensitive face, pale with uttermost horror and loathing
at the abominations around, though the revolt of the
shrinking nerves and senses was crushed down by a strong will,
and a look of profound compassion and sympathy effaced every
other expression. Instinctively Henri raised himself, and,
resting on his elbow, gazed at him with a hungry longing in his
heart that to him&mdash;even to him also&mdash;he would address so much
as a single word. At the same moment the stranger’s pitying
eye fell upon his young, sad, wasted face. “Et toi aussi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
pauvre enfant,” he said with tenderness, bending down once
more and touching Henri’s forehead gently with his hand.</p>

<p>Henri seized the hand in his and pressed it to his lips.
“Speak to me so again,” he cried, “and I verily believe I shall
not die, but live!”</p>

<p>His prayer was granted. He was spoken to, or rather spoken
<em>with</em>, until St. Priest drew near, and with an anxious air <em>entreated</em>,
not commanded, his companion to hasten onwards.</p>

<p>Then Henri covered his face with his thin hands and wept
quietly&mdash;almost the first tears he had shed since leaving Moscow.
The gentle shower softened the hard soil of his heart,
the flood-gates were thrown open, the fountains of the great
deep were unloosed, and the shower became a storm. “Mother,
mother!” he sobbed piteously, “O mother!” Wild and passionate
was the longing that swept him to see her face again, hers
and his sister’s. He thought of the old days&mdash;of his happy
childhood, of the love and tenderness that used to surround
him; and every thought unlocked afresh the source of tears.
He wept until he could weep no more.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Pontet followed the visitors as far as he could,
and then spoke to the guard at the door. He came back with
a beaming countenance and a manner full of suppressed excitement.
“Wonderful news, my comrades!” he began eagerly.
“Guess, if you can, who it is that has been among us&mdash;that
we took for the aide-de-camp of M. de St. Priest?”</p>

<p>“It was an angel from heaven,” murmured one poor sufferer,
lifting up a face flushed with fever. “There was light&mdash;rest
while he was here. Oh, if he could but have stayed! The
darkness is coming back now.”</p>

<p>“He has left the light with <em>me</em>,” said the Spaniard. “God
must have sent him here, his messenger, to fulfil my last wish.”</p>

<p>“But his name, his name?” cried the eager Pontet,&mdash;“no
one has guessed that yet. Will you try, or shall I tell you?
But if I do, you will not believe me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
“Tell us, tell us,” cried half-a-score of voices.</p>

<p>“The aide-de-camp of St. Priest was no other than our great
enemy&mdash;our conqueror, Alexander, Emperor of Russia!”</p>

<p>His auditors were utterly incredulous. “Have you lost your
senses, Pontet?” they cried; “or have the guards been mocking
you and us? Not a physician, not a nurse even, would enter
here were a fortune offered as a bribe; and do you expect us
to believe that the Czar, our enemy, would risk his life&mdash;<em>for
us</em>?”</p>

<p>“Listen,” answered Pontet; “the guards have told me all.
He has spent the whole day going through the other hospitals;&mdash;at
last he came here. M. de St. Priest, knowing
well how the deadly hospital fever is raging amongst us,
entreated, implored him not to enter. He would not listen.
Then the general, in a kind of desperation, flung himself
before the door, and, daring his sovereign to his face, told him
he should enter only over his body. The Czar put him gently
aside and walked in; and I tell you, comrades, there is not a
nook or corner in all this den of horrors that he has not
thoroughly explored. There was no hiding anything from him.
I take it, things will be altered with us from this time forth.
My friends, if there is any man amongst you happy enough still
to believe in God, let him thank him this night for sending the
Emperor Alexander here.”</p>

<p>When the comments made by others upon this speech had
died away, Henri raised his quivering, tear-stained face and
said gently, but with a new air of courage and firmness,
“Pontet, <em>I</em> believe in God; and I thank him&mdash;as you say.”
After a pause he added, “Dear comrades, if you will listen, I
should like to tell you how it is with me; for, perhaps, some
other poor lad may even now be struggling and suffering in
darkness, as I have been.”</p>

<p>“Say on,” cried several voices.</p>

<p>“When I was wandering through the snow, in hunger, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
misery, in despair, almost in madness, I lost my faith in God;&mdash;perhaps
because I never had the right kind of faith, because I
only believed that he was great and just, without believing that
he was <em>my</em> God. I fainted utterly. I thought either that he
was not, or that there was with him no love, no compassion. I
thought his pitiless hand was sweeping us all from the face of
the earth, because he was angry with Napoleon. I thought he
was like the great fire in Moscow, which burned, blazed,
destroyed, unchecked by human efforts, unstayed by human
prayers. May he forgive me! To-night I can believe in his
forgiveness and in his divine compassion. If the man who
was our enemy&mdash;whose land we tried to ruin, upon whom we
heaped every insult, every injury in our power&mdash;can pity and
forgive us, surely the God who made him will not be found
less merciful than he! Surely none but that God could so have
softened the proud heart of the Czar; and perhaps he has
done it just to show that even for those who have sinned deeply,
wilfully, like me, there is forgiveness with Him. Therefore let
us hope in the Lord; for with the Lord there is mercy, and
with him is plenteous redemption.”</p>

<p>There were murmurs of assent from the pale lips of many of
the sufferers around him; and Pontet observed, with a thoughtful
air, “The lad speaks well; and perhaps what he says may
be true. Who knows?”<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<span class="smcap1 t">The</span> very next day Henri de Talmont was removed
from the horrible Convent of St. Basil to one of the
other hospitals of the town&mdash;in which, indeed,
every palace, every public building sufficiently large,
was now being transformed into a hospital. As he passed
through the streets, he observed that large fires were burning
in all the thoroughfares; and the Russian physician who took
charge of the party of invalids told them this was done to
purify the air and to destroy infection.</p>

<p>A delicious sensation of rest stole over the weary frame of
Henri when at last he found himself lying on a comfortable
pallet, in a clean, well-warmed room. Nourishment sufficient
for his need and suitable to his weak condition was given him
with a willing hand. He had escaped the deadly hospital fever,
but the prostration of his strength was excessive, the vital forces
seemed exhausted. For many days he lay in a kind of contented
apathy, slumbering continually, and even when not
asleep floating in hazy dreams amongst vague remembrances of
the past. Once or twice he roused himself sufficiently to make
some inquiry after his fellow-sufferers. “Be at rest,” said his
nurse. “All are cared for now; just as well as the wounded
Russians.” But he used to waken up thoroughly whenever the
Emperor came to inspect the hospital where he lay. He would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
watch with pathetic eagerness for a word, even for a look, from
him, and live upon the recollection until his next visit. To
most of the other French prisoners the person of their benefactor
remained unknown; and as Alexander moved in and out
amongst them, listening to their complaints, ministering to their
needs, and speaking words of comfort, they took him generally
for the aide-de-camp of St. Priest.</p>

<p>One day Henri, feeling rather stronger than usual, observed
with interest a handsome, splendidly-equipped young Russian,
who had come to visit one of his countrymen in the same ward.
The conversation, carried on in their own language, was unintelligible
to Henri; but something in the face of the visitor
touched a chord of memory. The Russian, seeing the sick
Frenchman look at him earnestly, and as he thought imploringly,
came to his side and asked kindly in French, “Can I do
anything for you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, no; I thank you. I have everything I want.
Stay though,” he added with a slight increase of animation; “I
should like to know, if you will be good enough to tell me, how
the Grand Duke is to-day.”</p>

<p>Strange to say, the eccentric, passionate Constantine, at other
times even wantonly cruel, was now so wrought upon by the
example and influence of the brother he adored that he emulated
his works of mercy, and had actually caught the hospital fever in
his ministrations to the prisoners. Alexander himself seemed
to bear a charmed life through every peril; for God fulfilled
unto his servant the word upon which he had caused him to
hope: “A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at
thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.”</p>

<p>The Russian answered, “He is much better. Dr. Wylie
has pronounced him out of danger. You know Dr. Wylie?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he comes here often. He examined me one day, and
said he would like to bleed me, only I was too weak.”</p>

<p>The Russian could not suppress a smile. “You enjoyed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
most unusual exemption,” he said. “Dr. Wylie’s lancet is not
easily escaped. But I hope, as you <em>have</em> been so fortunate, that
you are growing stronger?”</p>

<p>“I scarcely know. I ought to be; for I am not in pain, not
hungry, not cold. All that is so strange now, so pleasant. But,
pardon me, have I not seen your face before? Where can it
have been?”</p>

<p>“I do not remember yours,” was the answer. That was not
wonderful; for Henri was a melancholy shadow of his former
self, with ghastly, shrunken features, and frame reduced to a
skeleton. The hardships of a very severe campaign had told
also upon Ivan Pojarsky, but in a different way; he looked
bronzed and weather-beaten, and much older than he really
was.</p>

<p>“I remember now,” Henri resumed after a pause. “I saw
you during the Occupation, in a church in Moscow. After the
service some Russians attacked me, and I might have been
killed, but for that brave fellow with one hand. He appealed
to you, and you protected me. Ah!” he added with a sigh, “if
I had known then what sufferings were before me, I might have
prayed you to plunge your sword into my breast!”</p>

<p>“I am glad to find you amongst the living,” Ivan said kindly.</p>

<p>“And that day,” mused Henri, “was little more than three
months ago, while it is but two since we left Moscow. Were
there ever two such months since the beginning of the world?”</p>

<p>“Of suffering?&mdash;I think not,” said Ivan thoughtfully, as he
took a seat beside him.</p>

<p>“Of suffering for us, of glory for <em>you</em>. How you must
triumph, you Russians! Five months ago Napoleon crossed
your border with half a million of men; and now the miserable
remains of that splendid host are dying in your hospitals,
pensioners of your bounty. Surely such an overthrow was
never seen since Pharaoh and his armies perished in the waters
of the Red Sea!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
“How we triumph, we Russians!” Ivan repeated. “Should
you like to know how? Our Emperor said the other day in
confidence to a friend, ‘This miserable campaign has cost me
ten years of my life!’”</p>

<p>“<em>Miserable!</em> when it has been for him and his one long glorious
victory!”</p>

<p>“True; but the sufferings he has witnessed have well-nigh
broken his heart.”</p>

<p>“The sufferings <em>of his enemies</em>,” said Henri, as tears filled his
eyes.</p>

<p>“They have so cast our own into the shade, that we ourselves
almost forget them. Yet you must not think we have suffered
nothing. Remember Moscow, our beautiful, our holy city;
remember Borodino and the other battles in which the best
blood of our country was poured out like water. Moreover,
the ice-king has thinned our ranks as well as yours.”</p>

<p>“Ah! not so fatally.”</p>

<p>“No; we had wholesome food, and warm clothing, and care
and comforts for the sick. As a rule, our invalids recovered,
while yours died. Yes, oh yes, God has surely given us a great
deliverance; would it had been at less cost to others! Look
here, monsieur,”&mdash;Ivan took a silver medal, new and bright,
from his neck, where it hung attached to a sky-blue ribbon.
“The Czar has just given one of these to every man who has
borne part in this winter’s campaign, from the general to the
youngest recruit.”</p>

<p>Henri examined it with interest. One side bore a Triangle
surrounded by rays, and in its centre an Eye.</p>

<p>“What does that mean?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“It is, with us, the symbol of the Divine Presence,” Ivan
answered, crossing himself. “It typifies the All-seeing and
Ever-present&mdash;the Three in One. Beneath, you read ‘1812,’
the ever-memorable year when He himself interposed to deliver
us. Now, turn the other side.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Henri did so, and saw, though he could not read, an inscription
in the old Slavonic tongue.</p>

<p>“That is, translated literally, ‘<em>Not us! not us! but His Name!</em>’
In your French Bible&mdash;the same which I use also&mdash;the verse
reads thus:&mdash;‘Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy
name give glory.’”</p>

<p>“Beautiful!” said Henri; and as he gave back the medal, he
looked with interest at the brilliant young Guardsman, who
spoke in such a simple, manly, unaffected way of God’s Word
and Providence.</p>

<p>“To-morrow the Czar leaves this,” said Ivan, replacing his
medal. “We of the Chevalier Guard go also, of course.”</p>

<p>Henri’s cry of distress made all the sick men in the ward
raise their heads.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” Ivan asked compassionately.</p>

<p>“The Emperor is going!” Henri said, or rather sobbed, for
so weak was he that he could not restrain his tears.</p>

<p>“You need not be afraid that will change anything, my poor
friend. He has made arrangements for the safety and the
comfort of all the prisoners. Henceforth they will want for
nothing.”</p>

<p>“I was not afraid of wanting food or shelter,” Henri said.
“But, M. le Garde, when I lay in that horrible prison, dying in
black despair, it was <em>his</em> voice called me back from the gates of
the grave, and showed me what the mercy of God was like. I
would give half the little life left in me to hear that voice yet
once again.” After a pause he added, with an effort to control
himself, “Still, he stayed among us longer than we could have
dared to hope. Is he going home now?”</p>

<p>Ivan shook his head. “His work is not half done yet; nor
ours,” he said.</p>

<p>“What will you fight for now?” asked Henri with a sad
smile. “For vengeance?”</p>

<p>“For <em>peace</em>,” returned Ivan. “Shall I tell you what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
Czar says about that? He speaks without anger or bitterness
of your Emperor.”</p>

<p>“Call him not <em>mine</em>,” Henri interrupted, with a flush on his
pale cheek. “Mine he never was. I am a Royalist.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, of Napoleon. ‘What a brilliant career,’ said
the Czar, ‘that man might have run! He could have given
peace to Europe&mdash;he could have done it; and he has not.
Now the charm is broken.’”</p>

<p>“At least you Russians cannot regret that,” said Henri with
enthusiasm; “for the olive crown of the peace-maker which
Napoleon has put aside awaits the brow of Alexander.”</p>

<p>“So said the friend to whom the Czar was speaking.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> ‘If
only peace is made,’ was his answer, ‘what does it matter by
whom, whether by him, or by me, or by another?’ It is a
good time to think of peace,” Ivan added. “To-morrow will
be Christmas day, when peace and good-will upon earth were
sung by the angels.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow?” repeated Henri. “Am I dreaming? Surely
I remember noticing that one of the first blessed, restful days
I spent here was Christmas day.”</p>

<p>“You forget,” said Ivan with a smile, “that we Russians
are behind the Western world by twelve days. Our Christmas
is your feast of the Epiphany. After divine service to-morrow,
the Czar begins his journey, and we follow.”</p>

<p>“You do not accompany him?”</p>

<p>“No; he travels with far greater speed than we could do.
For guards he never cares anything.”</p>

<p>“Strange,” said Henri&mdash;“strange; and how perilous! Think
of the country, overrun by war, swarming with stragglers from
the army, with desperate characters of every kind!”</p>

<p>“He has no fears,” returned Ivan; “nor we for him. Even
our white-haired general, with all the caution of his seventy
years, answered to some one who spoke as you do, ‘Who could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
have the courage to harm him?’<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> But, my friend, I must go
now, for it is late. Accept my best wishes for your recovery.”
He clasped Henri’s hand warmly, and contrived to leave in it
a few pieces of gold. Henri tried to remonstrate, but was
quickly silenced. “Soldiers always help one another; that is
a matter of course. If you like,” added Ivan, with a touch of
playful malice, “you can repay me after the first French victory.
Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“What a fine young fellow!” thought Ivan as he left the
hospital; “so grateful and so patient. And I have forgotten
even to ask his name! How thoughtless of me! Too late to
return now. But I am sure he is well born, particularly since
he calls himself a Royalist. Probably he belongs to one of
those noble families of the old <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">régime</i> Napoleon delights to
oppress and humble.”</p>

<p>Over Ivan himself great changes had passed, and were passing
even then. Perhaps his share in the foregoing conversation
has already indicated these with sufficient clearness; if not,
his conduct during the events that have yet to follow may complete
the picture.</p>

<p>Amongst the works of faith and love which in all ages have
been inspired by the precepts and the example of “the forgiving
Christ,” the labours of Alexander on behalf of his perishing
enemies undoubtedly deserve a place. It is good for the
world to keep such deeds in remembrance, although to those
who do them the world’s remembrance may avail but little.
It was not the motive that inspired, nor will it be the reward
that crowns them.</p>

<p>A few years later, at Cherson in the Crimea, Alexander stood
beside the grave of a philanthropist whose character and work
he held in genuine veneration&mdash;John Howard, the prisoners’
friend. With his own hand he designed a monument to mark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
the resting-place of Christ’s honoured servant, choosing for its
sole inscription those words of Christ himself&mdash;“I was sick, and
you visited me; I was in prison, and you came unto me.”
“Where the kings of the nations lie in glory, every one in his
own house,” the Czar Alexander Paulovitch has his stately
sleeping-place; and well might it bear the same inscription.
No human hand has placed it there; but we doubt not Divine
lips will one day utter the commendation, “Inasmuch as you
have done it unto one of the least of these, you have done it
unto Me.”</p>

<span class="smcap1 b">Between</span> opening month of 1813 and that of
the following year a great change swept over
Europe. Men of Teutonic race, true-hearted sons
of their dear Fatherland, look back upon that era
with honourable pride. They talk with enthusiasm of “the
war of liberation,” telling gratefully beside their hearths, or
by the vine-clad banks of their glorious “German Rhine,” how
prince and peasant armed for the fight, and flung from them
the intolerable yoke of the foreign oppressor. Körner’s patriotic

<p class="in0">In that memorable battle fought long ago in the valley of Elah,
we are told how the men of Israel arose with a great shout, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
rushing upon their Philistine oppressors, chased them with tremendous
slaughter to the very gates of their own fastnesses.
It was a glorious victory; but it would scarcely have been won
at all if the Hebrew champion had not first slain Goliath
“in the name of the Lord of Hosts, the God of the armies
of Israel.” In like manner the battle of the deliverance of
Europe was really fought and won upon the frozen plains of
Russia.</p>

<p>The early days of 1813 found the Russian hosts upon the
frontiers of their own country. Within that country, through
the blessing of God upon their valour and constancy, not an
enemy remained except in captivity. By the first month of
1814 the still victorious armies of the Czar had reached the
boundaries of France. That unhappy land seemed now about
to suffer what she, or her rulers, had once and again inflicted
upon others. “Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not
spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously
with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be
spoiled; and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously,
they shall deal treacherously with thee.” So has it ever been
since the world began: wrong begets wrong, cruelty engenders
cruelty; “they that take the sword perish with the sword.”
It was the hour of retribution. Slavs and Teutons, whose
homes and hearths had been made desolate by French bayonets,
gazed, flushed with triumph, on the fertile plains of France,
and promised themselves and their dead a terrible vengeance.
“We will reward her even as she rewarded us, and the cup
which she hath filled we will fill to her double,” they said in
their hearts. It was the voice of Nature.</p>

<p>But in that hour another voice was heard. “Soldiers,” said
Alexander to the armies of Russia, “your valour and your
perseverance have brought you from the Oka to the Rhine.
We are about to enter a country with which we are waging
a sanguinary and obstinate war. The enemy, entering our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
empire, brought on us great evils, but suffered for it an awful
punishment. Let us not take example by them; cruelty and
ferocity cannot be pleasing in the eyes of a merciful God. Let
us forget their deeds, and render them, not vengeance and
hatred, but friendship, and a hand stretched out for peace.
Such is the lesson taught by our holy faith. Divine lips have
pronounced the command, ‘Love your enemies; do good to
them that hate you.’ Soldiers, I trust that by your moderation
in the enemy’s country you will conquer as much by generosity
as by arms; and, uniting the valour of the soldier against the
armed with the charity of the Christian towards the unarmed,
you will crown your exploits by keeping stainless your well-earned
reputation of a brave and moral people.” This was
<em>not</em> the voice of Nature, but of Grace.</p>

<p>But these noble words, did they die upon the ears of those
who heard them, leaving only an echo, faint though musical,
to remind them of the existence of such things as mercy and
humanity? or did they really prove strong enough to restrain
the excited passions of a hundred thousand fighting men?
Strange to tell, the voice of Alexander was obeyed. It was
not easy to secure such obedience; it would not have been
even possible, had not he whose lips uttered the command
been passionately loved, as well as feared and honoured. But
a touching proof how well it was secured was given years
afterwards. When, through the length and breadth of
Europe, the tidings flashed from lip to lip, “The Emperor of
Russia is dead,” the peasants of the French provinces through
which he marched at the head of a victorious hostile army
crowded unbidden to their churches to offer their humble
prayers, useless indeed but sincere, for the repose of his soul.</p>

<p>Two months of hard fighting brought the Allies from the
banks of the Rhine to those of the Marne, which they crossed
on the 28th of March, and found themselves in the rich and
fertile plain that surrounds Paris. The Chevaliers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
Imperial Guard had borne their full share in the glories and
dangers of the war; for their place was near the person of a
sovereign of whom it was said with truth that “the only life
he ever exposed without reflection was his own.” Their ranks
were sorely thinned: one gallant youth had fallen by a shot
from the same battery as that which killed Moreau, two at
Toplitz, others at Leipzig and elsewhere. But their arms were
as bright, their equipages as splendid, as when they left the
banks of the Neva; and their massy silver cuirasses reflected
the sunshine of France from surfaces as stainless as those
which flashed upon the parade-ground of St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>Ivan Pojarsky was an ensign now&mdash;he had won his colours
on the banks of the Elbe&mdash;and he wore besides the Order of
St. George along with the Moscow medal on the breast of his
crimson tunic. He had escaped without a wound; but his friend
Tolstoi was looking very pale, and had his left hand in a sling.</p>

<p>As the Chevaliers rode together towards Paris on the evening
of the 29th of March, their party was joined by some noble
young Prussian volunteers, their personal friends. One of these,
named Schubart, was vaunting to the Russians the courage and
ability of Blucher, and telling them the story of some of his
exploits.</p>

<p>“All that is very well,” said Tolstoi, with a little irritation.
“Far be it from me to deny that Prince Blucher is a brave
soldier and a good general. But where, I ask you, would he
be now, but for his Russian auxiliaries? You know as well as
I that his army contains four Russians for one Prussian.
Still,” he pursued, “there is all the difference in the world
between your fine old hero and that Austrian trimmer and
time-server, who, I verily believe, would have us all prisoners
in the camp of Napoleon, if he were left to himself.”</p>

<p>“I am not any more in love with Prince Schwartzenberg
than you are,” said the Prussian; while Ivan whispered to
Tolstoi, with a warning glance, “Take care.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
“Oh yes, I’ll take care,” answered Tolstoi lightly. Then, as
a spasm of pain passed across his face, “What a nuisance this
hand is! Lucky it is not the right one, though.”</p>

<p>“If it had been,” said Ivan, “you would have done as
Diebitch did at Austerlitz&mdash;taken the sword in your left, and
fought on.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to see you are wounded,” remarked Schubart.
“How was it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is nothing,” returned Tolstoi. “I got the hurt three
days ago, in that fight with Pacthod’s corps.”</p>

<p>“A brilliant affair. We have all heard of it,” said the
Prussian.</p>

<p>“Ay,” answered Tolstoi; “those Frenchmen fought like
demons.”</p>

<p>“Like heroes, you mean,” said Ivan. “Certainly the empire
Napoleon has kept over the hearts of his soldiers is no less
than a miracle, especially when we know how little he would
care if all of them were dead to-morrow, provided he had
as good to replace them. It was sixteen thousand men with
guns and cavalry against six thousand without either; and yet
they would not yield to us. Our guns raked their lines.
Still they stood undaunted, resolved to resist to the death. The
Czar sent an aide-de-camp with a flag of truce to them. They
shot him dead.”<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>“Not <em>very</em> chivalrous that,” Schubart interposed.</p>

<p>“No, truly. But how gallantly they fought! They would
have kept their places till they were cut to pieces, man by
man. And to that it must have come, but the Czar would
not have it. He called on us to follow&mdash;us of the Chevalier
Guard,” said Ivan with a look of pride&mdash;“and dashed headlong
into the midst of them, breaking up and scattering their
compact square by the sheer impetus of his charge. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
glorious <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mêlée</i>&mdash;the grandest I have ever seen. Think of Pacthod
giving his sword into the Czar’s own hand, and not dreaming
until afterwards that the gallant cavalry officer whose courage
and promptitude averted a massacre was the Emperor himself!”<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>“Ach, wunderschön!” cried Schubart. “Herr Tolstoi, I
would take your wound twice over to have been in the midst
of it.”</p>

<p>“Look!” Ivan suddenly exclaimed, pointing to the scene
before them. While absorbed in their eager talk, they had
been ascending an eminence, from the top of which they now
caught their first sight of the magnificent capital of France.
The sun had just set, but its parting beams still lingered upon
the gilded dome of the Hôtel des Invalides and the stately
summit of the Pantheon. “Paris! Paris!” was the exclamation
that broke from every lip, and resounded far and wide in
lengthened cries of fierce joy and exultation. “Paris! Paris!”
was shouted again and yet again, as rank after rank of that
gallant army beheld the goal of all their aspirations, the end
of all their toils.</p>

<p>After the first involuntary cry Ivan was silent. At length
he said quietly to his friend Tolstoi, “When I think of that
terrible September, the last but one, and of the flames of
Moscow, the wonder and the gladness seem too great, too awful
for words.”</p>

<p>“Those flames are burning in many a heart now,” Tolstoi
answered.&mdash;“I suppose they will hardly let us in yonder without
a struggle,” he added in an altered tone. “What will to-morrow
bring?”</p>

<span class="smcap1 t">The</span> passion and the tumult, the glory and the agony
of the next day will live in History as long as
History herself lives to depict the scenes of blood
and violence which earth has witnessed. No battle
in that terrible war was more hotly or more obstinately contested
than the battle of Paris; although it ought to be remembered
that it was not the men of Paris who contested every
inch of ground with the Allies, but the corps of Marmont and
Mortier, old soldiers of Napoleon, the National Guard, and the
youths of the Ecole Polytechnique.</p>

<p>The sun that shone upon that long day’s conflict was already
near its setting when Ivan, with the rest of the Chevalier Guard,
was still straining every nerve to drive the French from the
Butte de Chaumont, an important height commanding the city.
It is not enough to say that he fought with gallantry: all did
that. He fought as one whose whole soul was in the work&mdash;who
was conscious of no thought, no impulse, no resolve
save that Paris must be won for the Czar that day. His
horse was at a gallop; his red sabre was driving the fleeing
French before him; the crest of the hill was reached; the city
lay outspread beneath his feet;&mdash;when a well-aimed bullet grazed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
the top of his silver cuirass, and passed through his right shoulder.
Faint and dizzy, he still pressed on. To be stopped <em>now</em>
would be intolerable. But in another moment his senses reeled;
all things grew dim about him. He had barely time to thrust
the colours which he held into the hand of the comrade nearest
him; then, after clutching vainly at the mane of his horse, he
found himself lying under its hoofs. Immeasurably bitter was
the thrill of disappointment that flashed through him ere consciousness
departed. “I shall <em>not</em> enter Paris with my Czar,” he
murmured with his failing voice. After that he knew nothing.</p>

<p>When he came to himself he was still lying on the ground
where he had fallen. Blood was flowing freely from the wound
in his shoulder, but no hoof of horse had grazed him as he lay&mdash;all
had passed him by, sparing the fallen, as those noble and
gentle creatures so often do. He heard voices near him, and
to his joy they spoke in <em>Russian</em>. Then the Butte de Chaumont
was theirs yet! He raised himself with an effort, and
looked about him. It was night, but lights were blazing all
around. A party of artillery occupied the height which he
and his comrades had won for them, and the gunners were
standing, match in hand, beside their loaded pieces. It was
evident that the word of command to fire upon the city that
lay outspread beneath them was expected every instant. Fierce
and eager was the excitement. The passionate, exulting anticipation
which kindled every eye and throbbed in every heart
resounded on all sides in “houras” and “vivas,” while from
lip to lip along the ranks the cry was echoed and re-echoed,
“Father Paris, you shall pay for Mother Moscow!”</p>

<p>A voice near Ivan&mdash;a voice that Ivan knew&mdash;exclaimed, in
tones of deepest emotion, “Thank God and the saints, we have
our revenge this night for our beautiful and holy city, laid in
ashes&mdash;ay, and for our dead, our <em>murdered</em>! Anna Popovna,
in <em>thy</em> name I send the messenger of Death into the homes of
the infidel Nyemtzi.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
“Michael! Michael Ivanovitch!” Ivan called in a faint and
quivering voice.</p>

<p>Fortunately Michael heard the sound, and moved towards
the spot whence it came. “Great St. Nicholas!” exclaimed
he, “it is Barrinka!”</p>

<p>A good soldier always knows what to do for a wounded
comrade. Water, mixed with a little brandy, was quickly
borne to the lips of Ivan; and gladly would Michael have
bound the wound himself, only he thought it right to yield the
privilege to some one who had the use of both his hands.
“But what shall we do for linen?” asked the gunner who
undertook the surgeon’s office.</p>

<p>“Here is the very thing we want!” cried Michael, delightedly
producing from his knapsack a clean white cambric handkerchief.</p>

<p>“A token from some fair one, I suppose,” said his comrade
with a laugh, as he took it from his hand.</p>

<p>“A token from some one harder to find,” returned Michael.
“From a Frenchman with a notion of justice and mercy in his
head.”</p>

<p>“The Frenchmen shall learn what justice is before the dawn
of to-morrow’s sun,” said the gunner with a dark and angry look.</p>

<p>He bound Ivan’s wound as well as he could, gave him a little
more brandy and water, and then, with Michael’s assistance,
placed him on a kind of couch made of cloaks and blankets.
Meanwhile their companions kindled a fire, the warmth of
which proved welcome to all the party.</p>

<p>“I feel quite comfortable now,” said Ivan. “Thank you,
my brothers.”</p>

<p>At that moment an exclamation of amazement broke from
the entire group. Upon a pole, on an eminence near them, a
white flag was visible through the darkness. Bitter murmurs,
even cries of disappointment, began to be heard. “Can it be,”
cried Michael, “that they are dreaming of a truce now&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>now&mdash;with
the city in our very hands? It must be those
accursed treacherous Austrians or those fools of Prussians who
are showing the white feather. But the Czar will never listen
to them&mdash;<em>never</em>!”</p>

<p>“Never!” eagerly assented all around. “He remembers
the flames of Moscow.”</p>

<p>They were not left long in suspense. Presently an aide-de-camp,
galloping along the lines, brought the orders of the
Czar: “Extinguish your matches. Pile your muskets. The
city is about to capitulate.”</p>

<p>The order was obeyed, but with a great and bitter cry, like
the cry of a wild beast that sees his prey escape him. Rage
and disappointment filled every heart to overflowing. Michael
flung himself on his knees beside his now useless gun, covering
his face with his one hand, while the tears rolled down his
weather-beaten cheeks.</p>

<p>Touched by his distress, Ivan called him to his side. “What
is the matter, friend?” he asked gently.</p>

<p>“Matter, Barrinka? Matter enough to break the heart of a
man who has marched from Moscow to Paris with only one
thought, one hope in his heart&mdash;the hope of vengeance.”</p>

<p>“I cannot blame you, Michael. You have bitter wrongs to
avenge.”</p>

<p>“Ay, Barrinka,” answered he, choking down the emotion he
did not wish to betray. “I see nothing day and night but that
sweet pale face with the look of death upon it. Only killing
Nyemtzi makes it go away now and then for a little while.
All this time I have been thinking, perhaps if we kill Nyemtzi
enough&mdash;kill and destroy them utterly&mdash;<em>utterly</em>,” he repeated,
sending out the word with a hissing sound through his clenched
teeth, “that face may go or change&mdash;change back again,” he
added more gently, “to the old happy look it used to have in
the bygone days when she was my betrothed, before the Nyemtzi
came and ruined everything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
“I think, Michael, there may be another way to bring the
change you long for,” began Ivan; but Michael interrupted him.</p>

<p>“No!” he cried passionately&mdash;“no way but killing Nyemtzi.
That is all the joy left me now upon earth. And the Czar will
not let us do it.”</p>

<p>“He will not,” said Ivan. “That is true. Remember,
Michael, that he who forbids it is the Czar Alexander Paulovitch&mdash;no
one else.”</p>

<p>“If it <em>were</em> any one else,” returned Michael gloomily, “we
should tear him to pieces.”</p>

<p>“What do you suppose has made the Czar forbid it? Ever
since we entered this land of the enemy, he has held back his
avenging armies, as one might hold a bloodhound in the leash
from springing on his prey. Is it that <em>he</em> has no wrongs to
revenge; that <em>he</em> has forgotten holy Moscow and the Kremlin
and the outraged tombs of his fathers?”</p>

<p>“‘The Czar is God upon earth,’” said Michael, quoting the
proverb of his people. “He does what he pleases. How could
such as I pretend to understand him?&mdash;Are you suffering, Barrinka?”
he asked, as Ivan stirred uneasily and shivered.</p>

<p>“Not much. I think it is the chill before the morning that
I feel. Wrap that cloak around me, please, and give me a
little more brandy.”</p>

<p>Michael did so, saying, as he tried to fasten the cloak, “If I
had my other hand, I would do it better for you, Barrinka.”</p>

<p>“You have done it well, my friend; but you must often
miss your hand, and regret its loss.”</p>

<p>“Regret it!” cried Michael with the old enthusiasm flashing
from his eyes. “<em>Never!</em> Did I not give it for the Czar?”</p>

<p>“Michael, listen to me. As you love and honour the Czar,
so the Czar loves and honours <em>his King</em>.”</p>

<p>“<em>His</em> king?” repeated Michael, wondering. But a moment
afterwards he made the sign of the cross. “I understand,” he
said in a lower voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
Ivan resumed: “The thought of vengeance may have been
dear to him&mdash;dear as was your hand to you&mdash;still at the command
of his King, and for his sake, it was surrendered, and
that joyfully. You see?”</p>

<p>“I see.” Michael relapsed into silence, and stood gazing
thoughtfully upon the city spread out beneath their feet, and
growing every moment clearer in the dawning light. At last
he said, turning once again to Ivan, “Barrinka, it is true I
gave my hand for the Czar. But I never thought he would
care&mdash;or even hear of it. He did though; he spoke to me with
his own lips. He thanked me, and said I had been found
faithful. Not <em>one</em> hand, but two, would have been well lost for
that. But will his King speak to the Czar and thank him?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Ivan answered, “he will, thought I cannot tell how.
God has many ways of speaking to his servants.”</p>

<p>In due time the day broke, and the sun arose over Paris.
Then came relief and refreshment for the troops, and surgical
help and care for the wounded. Then came also the tidings,
flashing from rank to rank, “The capitulation is signed. The
city has surrendered <em>without conditions</em>. At half-past three
o’clock this morning, the keys of Paris were placed in the hands
of Alexander.”</p>

<span class="smcap1 t">The</span> two years so eventful to others had not passed
without change over the mother and sister Henri
de Talmont left sorrowing behind him in the cottage
at Brie. That he had joined the corps of
recruits instead of making his escape soon became known
to them. Both were stricken to the heart; and because this
was so, the grief of both was still and silent. Clémence told
her mother Henri’s parting words, upon which a mournful light
was thrown by what followed. But these brought little comfort,
and no tidings since had reached them from the wanderer.
As may have been inferred, the letter intrusted to Seppel was
never posted; and Henri did not write again.</p>

<p>At length came news of the appalling disasters in Russia.
Neither Madame de Talmont nor Clémence indulged the faintest
hope that Henri could have survived them. They mourned
for the one who “was not,” in an utter desolation, beyond
words and beyond tears.</p>

<p>Sometimes they murmured sadly to each other, “If only we
knew the truth.” For it was one of the bitterest drops in their
full cup of bitterness that they could not tell in what form

how hideous and revolting were some of the forms assumed by
the king of terrors. Horrible details reached them, piercing
the thick veil of falsehood with which Napoleon sought to hide
the disasters of his army; and imagination&mdash;that magician so
powerful for good and evil&mdash;exercised a fearful ingenuity in
torturing their aching hearts to the uttermost.</p>

<p>These were pangs they endured in common; but each had
besides her solitary burden of pain. That of the mother was
tinged with something like the bitterness of remorse. She had
been wroth with her boy for deceiving her and betraying the
cause she held dearer than life. Pride and anger had kept her
back from obeying the first impulse of her heart when she
heard of him as amongst the conscripts who left the village.
She thought of hastening after him to Paris, that he might not
go forth to die without his mother’s pardon and her blessing.
But she put the thought aside. The difficulties in her way
would have been very great, yet it was not these that deterred
her. It was the persuasion that he did not deserve this sacrifice
at her hands&mdash;that the first step towards a reconciliation ought
to come from him. If he wished for it, why had he not written?&mdash;But
now everything was changed. With vain tears that had
no healing in them the broken-hearted mother mourned over
“the irrevocable past.”</p>

<p>Clémence too had her lonely sorrow. Deeply thoughtful and
truly pious, after the strong, stern, self-sacrificing Jansenist
fashion, she knew too well that her brother’s young heart
had never truly surrendered itself to its Creator and Redeemer.
The “Except ye be converted” of the Divine Teacher held as
real a place in the creed of Clémence as in that of any Protestant;
nor, under the circumstances, could the Catholic belief in
sacramentary grace interpose its soft, misleading glamour between
her eyes and the truth. So her soul went down to
the depths of a sorrow without hope; depths that few are
strong enough to sound, and those who do sound them seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
tell what they find there. Some, it may be, bring back
from thence secrets of divine love, “treasures of the deep that
lieth under,” worth all they have passed through to learn
them. But it was not so with Clémence. She brought no
pearls with her from the deeps of ocean. It was much if she
herself came back, or rather <em>drifted</em> back, forlorn and weary,
because mind and body were no longer strong enough to bear
the strain of intense emotion. She said in her heart,&mdash;as
poor Henri thought she would do all too easily,&mdash;“It is the
will of God;” but she never truly said, “Thy will be done.”
Perhaps she made her heavy burden heavier by asking from
herself what God never asked from her; forgetting that it is
<em>not</em> his will that any sinner should perish, and that Christ himself
wept tears of divine compassion over lost souls. So her
own faith grew dim and clouded, until even the sense of personal
love to God seemed to vanish away, and with it the trust
in his love to her; for, unhappily, her creed did <em>not</em> teach her
that his love to his chosen and adopted is “everlasting.”</p>

<p>In the course of time an outward change was mercifully sent
to break up the current of those two sorrowful lives. A
widowed sister of Madame de Talmont’s mother had been able
to retain a portion of her property through all the storms of
the Revolution. Madame de Salgues had lost both her sons,
and only one grandson remained to her, the object of her passionate
devotion. But the agents of Napoleon kept watch over
the lad, as a scion of the old noblesse; and when he had
attained a suitable age, Madame de Salgues was requested to
send him to the Ecole Polytechnique, such a request being too
evidently a command. She wept, but had to obey; removing,
however, to Paris, in order to be near him. But the superintendent
of police, the notorious Savary, had a word to say upon
that subject; and the poor old lady was soon forbidden to reside
within the city. Remonstrance was useless; so she retired to
Versailles, where she was still near enough to receive frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
visits from her grandson. Finding herself alone and lonely,
with failing health and depressed spirits, she thought of Madame
de Talmont; and very wisely wrote offering a comfortable home
to her and her daughter, if they would come and cheer her
declining years.</p>

<p>The invitation was accepted with thankfulness; and the first
faint gleams of comfort stole unconsciously into the darkened
hearts of Madame de Talmont and Clémence as they sought to
soothe the sorrows of another. Poor Madame de Salgues had
soon a fresh grief to mourn over. Like all her family, she was
a stanch Legitimist, and she had brought up her grandson in the
same political creed; but he could not long withstand the influence
of his new surroundings. Before he had been three months
at the Ecole Polytechnique, his teachers and fellow-pupils had
wrought a rapid conversion, and made him as fiery and unreasoning
a partisan of Napoleon as he had once been of the Bourbons.
Emile de Salgues was not a lad whose opinions upon any
subject were likely to be of particular importance to the rest
of the world, but to Madame de Salgues the apostasy of her
grandson from the good cause was a very grievous affliction.</p>

<p>The invasion of France by the Allies, and the attack upon
Paris, caused many apprehensions to the household of unprotected
ladies; but, as they themselves would have expressed
it, they were “quitte pour la peur,” no adversary nor evil of
any kind came near them. They all rejoiced at the overthrow
of Napoleon, but with trembling, and that for more reasons
than one,&mdash;they could not yet believe it was real, and
they had not the slightest idea of what was to take his
place.</p>

<p>On the day following the entry of the conquerors into Paris,
Madame de Talmont said to her daughter, “Clémence, the
Allies have sent their wounded here.”</p>

<p>Clémence looked up from the embroidery upon which she was
engaged. Two years of sorrow had changed the young girl into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
grave and quiet woman; but there was even a rarer beauty
than of old in her pale and sculptured face. “There must be
many wounded,” she remarked with an air of sadness. “Every
one says the fight was an obstinate one.”</p>

<p>“The hospital is full to overflowing. Clémence, they are all
of them mothers’ sons, <em>also</em>.”</p>

<p>In the last word there was an undertone of pain that went
straight to the heart of Clémence. “True, dear mother,” she
said softly.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking,” Madame de Talmont resumed, “that
it would do us good to try and comfort some of them, even a
little. What should <em>we</em> feel now, if we knew that any one had
done it for our beloved?”</p>

<p>With Clémence a call to action always found a ready response.
“What can we do, mother?” she asked with even a
touch of eagerness.</p>

<p>“To some of the sick men fruit may be welcome; to others,
a little money to buy the trifling luxuries they may long for;
to all, kind words will not be valueless.”</p>

<p>“But, mother, they are Germans and Russians. They will
not understand us.”</p>

<p>“Some of them will. At all events, we can try.”</p>

<p>An hour afterwards, two ladies dressed in deep mourning
and closely veiled entered the Hospital of Versailles. Each
carried a basket filled with grapes and oranges, which they
easily obtained permission to distribute amongst the patients.</p>

<p>“These are all Russians who are here,” they were told; “the
Prussians and Austrians have been provided for in other
places.”</p>

<p>The sufferers were well cared for, as well at least as circumstances
permitted. A liberal allowance was made for their
support by their own government; and the Mayor of Versailles
interested himself so warmly in their welfare, that the
Czar afterwards wrote him an autograph letter of thanks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
Madame de Talmont and Clémence passed between long rows
of pallets, distributing their little gifts, which were most thankfully
received, especially the oranges, of which the Russians
were excessively fond. They tried to show their gratitude by
looks and signs; and one poor fellow, remembering a word
which is the same in most languages and full of blessing in all,
brought tears to the sad eyes of Clémence by looking up and
murmuring, “Christohs;” as though he would have said, “We
are one in Him.”</p>

<p>They came at last to the ward where the wounded officers
lay. Their little store was long since exhausted; and even had
it been otherwise, they would have thought the common soldiers
greater objects of compassion. So they passed on rather quickly,
and without paying much heed to the pale but interested faces
which were raised from many a pillow to gaze at the gentle,
sweet-looking ladies, the very sight of whom seemed to do the
poor sufferers good.</p>

<p>At length one face arrested the eye of Madame de Talmont,
and she could not but pause for another look. It was a young
and handsome face, with a burning spot on either cheek, and a
contraction of the brows that told the story of feverish pain.
Yet, in spite of weariness and suffering, the eyes were absolutely
beaming with joy, and a happy, satisfied smile played over the
parted lips.</p>

<p>She stood for a moment by the side of the invalid. “My
young friend,” she said kindly, “you seem to be in pain; and
yet you look happy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame, I am indeed happy,” answered Ivan Pojarsky,
who had just been receiving a visit from his friend Tolstoi.
“How can I help it? Yesterday the Czar entered Paris in
triumph.”</p>

<p>He spoke French as correctly and with almost as pure an
accent as Madame de Talmont herself. She was touched and
interested by his words. “But,” she asked, “do you not feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
it hard to be lying here, helpless and suffering, while your
Emperor and your companions in arms enjoy their triumph?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, madame,” he said with animation; “I cannot think
of that. Nor could you, if you belonged to my Czar. If you
had seen the flames of Moscow; had heard the thunder when
the mines exploded that laid half our Kremlin in ruins; had
witnessed the faith and courage that upheld him <em>then</em>, had
watched the long and weary conflict he has waged from that
hour until now&mdash;patient, wise, self-sacrificing, undaunted<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>,&mdash;you
would rejoice for him in the very depths of your heart that
the goal is won at last, that he stands a conqueror in the
midst of Paris, and possesses the gate of his enemies!” In his
eagerness he half raised himself, his eyes sparkled, and his
whole face flushed with excitement.</p>

<p>“Gently, gently, my poor young friend,” said Madame de
Talmont in a tone of almost motherly tenderness. “I fear you
will hurt yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, madame;”&mdash;but even as he spoke his colour changed
rapidly, and his lip quivered with the pain he tried to hide.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, many thoughts were passing through the mind
of the silent but observant Clémence. There was a little stand
beside the bed, upon which were a phial containing medicine,
a small book, and a clean white cambric handkerchief. She
saw, with interest and pleasure, that the book was a copy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
the New Testament in French. Then her eye rested upon
the folded cambric, and presently a cry of amazement broke
from her lips.</p>

<p>Every one started and looked towards her. Madame de
Talmont was terror-stricken. So quiet and self-contained had
Clémence ever been, that even in childhood a cry from her lips
was a thing almost unknown. And now, with a face as white
as that of any of the stricken sufferers around them, she was
placing the handkerchief in the hand of her mother. “Look,”
she faltered&mdash;“look, mother!”</p>

<p>Ivan called an attendant, fortunately within reach. “Will
you kindly place seats for these ladies?” he said, for he saw
that the agitation of the mother was as great as that of the
daughter. Both were gazing spell-bound at the crest, worked
curiously and skilfully on a corner of the handkerchief, and
having beneath it the initials “H. de T.” No wonder; for it
was the fingers of Clémence that had wrought every stitch, and
her mother’s eyes had watched the work. In both hearts a
horrible dread succeeded to the first rush of uncontrollable and
unreasoning emotion. Was this amongst the spoils of the dead?</p>

<p>Ivan watched them with pitying eyes. “Have the goodness
to be seated, madame and mademoiselle,” he said. “A
little nearer, please; I cannot speak very loud. But I think I
have something to tell you.”</p>

<p>They obeyed mechanically; and Madame de Talmont said
falteringly, pointing to the initials on the handkerchief, “He
was my son.”</p>

<p>“<em>Is</em>,” Ivan corrected.</p>

<p>From that moment to her dying day Madame de Talmont
loved the voice that uttered that blessed monosyllable.</p>

<p>“I have good hope, madame, that God has preserved
him to you through many dangers,” Ivan went on. “I saw
him twice&mdash;the last time at Vilna, after the perils and horrors
of the retreat were over. He was lying sick in a hospital there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
Not with any malady, only worn out with hunger, cold, and
weariness. Every care was afforded him, and every kindness
shown that circumstances permitted; and so, I trust&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But,” Clémence interrupted, “can we be sure there is no
mistake? M. le Russe, how did you become possessed of
this?” pointing to the handkerchief.</p>

<p>“In a strange way, mademoiselle,” said Ivan, fixing his deep
blue eyes on her face. “A young peasant, a friend of my
childhood, was made prisoner by the French as they were
marching upon Moscow. They branded him in the hand with
the letter N, telling him that now he belonged to their Emperor,
Napoleon. The brave fellow took out his axe and struck
off the hand, saying to them, ‘Take what belongs to your
Emperor; as for me, I belong wholly to the Czar.’ Then,
mademoiselle, monsieur, your&mdash;your brother, I presume, stepped
forward before them all, like the gallant and chivalrous gentleman
he is, and bound up the poor lad’s wounded arm with
his own handkerchief.”</p>

<p>A look of pride and pleasure flashed over the pale face of
Clémence&mdash;and Ivan saw it.</p>

<p>He resumed, “It was in Moscow, during the Occupation,
that I met him first. My friend pointed him out to me in one
of our churches. He found his way there, for he said it did
him good to see men kneel in prayer to God, though he could
not understand their words. Afterwards, as I told you, I
saw him in the hospital at Vilna.”</p>

<p>Absorbed though she was in the interest of his narrative,
Clémence perceived that Ivan was growing faint “Mother,”
she whispered, “I fear we are hurting him. Let us go.”</p>

<p>“Only one word more,” said Ivan. “You wish to know
how <em>I</em> came by that,” again indicating the handkerchief. “My
friend Michael treasured it carefully as a souvenir, and when I
was wounded the other night, he used it to bind the wound.
Knowing how he prizes it, I was careful to have it washed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
kept it by me to give him when he comes to see me. Now it is
better in your hands.”</p>

<p>Here one of the surgeons, who for some time had been
hovering uneasily about the group, interposed and courteously
requested the visitors to withdraw. He said, as he attended them
to the door, “Pardon me, ladies, for interrupting your conversation,
but I must take care of my patient, who will be in
a high fever to-night if he excites himself any further. Indeed,
I fear mischief has been done already&mdash;not by <em>you</em>, ladies,” he
added with a bow, “but by one of his comrades, who came to
him this morning full of yesterday’s triumphal entry into the
city.”</p>

<p>“I hope,” Madame de Talmont contrived to say, in spite of
her extreme agitation,&mdash;“I hope he is not severely wounded?”</p>

<p>“Severely, but not dangerously,” was the answer. “He is
one of the finest young men we have, madame: an ensign in
the Emperor’s Chevalier Guard, and already very favourably
noticed by his Imperial Majesty.&mdash;Adieu, madame and mademoiselle:
we shall be happy to see you another day.”</p>

<span class="smcap1 i"><span class="epubonly">“</span>It</span> is enough: my son is yet alive; I shall see him
before I die.” These were the first words
Madame de Talmont found voice to falter, as,
leaning heavily on the arm of Clémence, she
traversed the short distance between the hospital and the
house where they dwelt.</p>

<p>The unutterable joy and thankfulness that filled the soul of
Clémence was not unmixed with fear. With the speechless,
agonizing dread of a loving heart, she trembled for the treasure
left her still. If, after this re-awakening of their hopes, the
only tidings that had to reach them were of a nameless grave at
Vilna, how could her mother bear the blow? Surely, had he
recovered, Henri would have written to them ere this. She
could not help concluding, from the young Russian’s narrative,
that he had met with sufficient kindness in the house of his
captivity to have rendered it easy for him to do so.</p>

<p>But she could not bear to communicate her misgivings.
She led her mother to the pleasant room they shared together,
and persuaded her to lie down and rest, taking upon herself
the task of relating what they had heard to La Tante, as they
both called Madame de Salgues.</p>

<p>During the long night that followed, bringing sleep to
neither, mother and daughter had abundant leisure for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
scattered, incoherent, “discursive talk” beneath which overwhelming
emotions usually conceal, because they cannot adequately
express, themselves. Morning had almost come when
Madame de Talmont asked, suddenly raising her head from
a hot, tear-stained pillow, “Clémence, what about a ransom?
We have that to think of now.”</p>

<p>“I <em>have</em> been thinking of it, mother,” Clémence answered
gently. “But peace will be made&mdash;<em>must</em> be made shortly. May
we not conclude that something will be arranged in it about
the prisoners?”</p>

<p>“If peace were to be made with any one save Napoleon, I
should say yes. Some men would think of their followers, and
try to make terms for them, were they themselves on the way
to the scaffold. But this Corsican adventurer has as little idea
of knightly honour as of Christian grace; while who can tell
yet what is to come after him? No, Clémence; you may depend
upon it those poor captives have no friends save God and their
own kinsfolk.&mdash;What can we do? Not even a jewel of any
value is left us now.”</p>

<p>“But, mother, we have still our little pittance in the Rentes.
Now that La Tante supplies all our real needs, we can sell
what is there.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is not enough, I fear, since the Rentes have fallen
so low. Yet it is all we have.&mdash;Clémence, I do not like Russians;
in fact, as a general thing, I have quite a prejudice
against them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, why?” asked Clémence, in tones rather more
earnest than the case demanded. “They could not help killing
our people; they were defending their native country,” she
added.</p>

<p>“Not for that, of course; but there are reasons which you
do not know. I was about to say, however, that young Russian
has interested and attracted me in spite of myself. He seems
quite a ‘preux chevalier;’ and,” she added more softly, “although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
he said nothing of it, I doubt not he showed kindness
to our dear one when he met him in the hospital at Vilna.
Besides, there is something in his face which I cannot describe,
but which haunts and troubles while it touches me. It seems
to remind me of some other face known long ago. We must
go and see him again to-morrow, and bring him some little
token of our gratitude. What do you think he would like,
Clémence?”</p>

<p>But they did <em>not</em> see Ivan on the morrow; for Madame de
Talmont was too ill to rise from her bed, and Clémence, even
if she had been willing to leave her, could not go to the hospital
alone. When, after an interval of three or four days, they
made their appearance once more, the courteous Russian
surgeon gave them quite a warm welcome.</p>

<p>“M. Pojarsky has been watching for you, mesdames,” he
said. “You will do him more good than any of our medicines.”</p>

<p>“Pojarsky!” Madame de Talmont repeated, as one in a
dream&mdash;“<i xml:lang="ru" lang="ru">Pojarsky!</i>”</p>

<p>Clémence was amazed to find her mother’s ready and graceful
courtesy fail her completely for once. By way of supplying her
unaccountable omission she ventured upon an inquiry for the
invalid.</p>

<p>“He has been very feverish, and has suffered a good deal
since,” the surgeon admitted. “But he is much better to-day.
Will you come to him at once, mesdames?”</p>

<p>“Willingly, monsieur, if you will be kind enough to distribute
these oranges amongst those who need them most,” said
Clémence, placing a large bag in the hands of the surgeon; for
her mother’s continued silence forced her to take the initiative.
“Mother,” she whispered, as they passed into the ward where
Ivan lay&mdash;“dear mother, what ails you?”</p>

<p>“That name awakens old associations&mdash;not happy ones,”
Madame de Talmont answered.</p>

<p>Ivan received his friends with a bright, glad smile of welcome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Since their last visit he had beguiled his hours of loneliness
and pain by endeavouring to recall every word, every look of
Henri’s, as a drop to be added to the cup of comfort he was
bearing to the lips of Henri’s mother and sister. Very pleasant
had the recognition been to him. Well could he imagine how
the solitary invalid far away in the hospital at Vilna must have
longed for those sweet faces, for the gentle touch of those kind
hands. What would <em>he</em> give for such a mother, such a sister,
to tend and care for him! But then his thoughts would revert
once more, with a thrill of thankful joy, to the triumph of the
Czar. How could he wish for anything else in the world when
Alexander was in Paris, and the flames of Moscow were
avenged?</p>

<p>At first Madame de Talmont seemed embarrassed, and a
faint pink flush lent unwonted colour to her pale cheek. But
Ivan’s detailed description of his interview with Henri at Vilna
arrested and held her with its absorbing interest.</p>

<p>“M. de Pojarsky,” she said, uttering the name with a little
hesitation, perhaps even reluctance, “if <em>you</em> have a mother
living, I pray God to send some one to comfort her, as you
have comforted me.”</p>

<p>“Ah, madame,” returned Ivan, “I have never known my
mother; she died in my earliest infancy. I am tempted to
envy M. de Talmont,” he added with a smile.</p>

<p>Madame de Talmont looked at him with quickened interest.
“May I ask,” she said rather quickly, “does your father
live? It is sad if one so young as you appear to be, stands
alone in the world.”</p>

<p>Ivan sighed. “I <em>am</em> alone in the world,” he said. “But
the strange thing is, that I cannot tell whether my father is
living or dead.”</p>

<p>“How is that?” pursued Madame de Talmont eagerly. But
Clémence interposed, from a kindly desire to spare the young
Russian a painful recital. “We can guess,” she said&mdash;“we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
have heard, even in France, of exiles in Siberia. We have
pitied their sufferings.”</p>

<p>Ivan’s white face flushed. “No one is sent to Siberia <em>now</em>”
he said eagerly, “who would not in any other country than
ours be far more severely punished. It was the Czarina who
exiled my father,” he continued with some excitement&mdash;“not
my Czar.”</p>

<p>“Do not think me unkind or discourteous,” Madame de
Talmont said gently, “if I venture to inquire what was the
offence laid to his charge. I have a reason.”</p>

<p>“I can answer without pain or reluctance,” said Ivan. “My
father’s disgrace and banishment, and my mother’s death, which
quickly followed, took place in my infancy; and the kind but
simple people who cared for me and brought me up could tell
me very little. But from that little I have gathered that my
father, being in Paris at the outbreak of the Revolution,
became involved in the crimes of the Jacobins, rather from
youthful thoughtlessness than from any deliberate evil intention.”</p>

<p>“<em>Ah!</em>” said Madame de Talmont.</p>

<p>Something in her tone made Ivan raise himself to look at
her. “Madame,” he asked quickly, “did you know my
father?”</p>

<p>“That is a question I shall be better able to answer if you
on your part will tell me&mdash;was your mother a Frenchwoman?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame,” said Ivan, looking greatly agitated.</p>

<p>“Have you ever heard her name?”</p>

<p>“Not her family name, madame. Her Christian name I
know&mdash;Victoire.”</p>

<p>Madame de Talmont wrestled in silence with some emotion,
and conquered it. Then taking Ivan’s hand in hers, she said
kindly, even with tenderness, “My dear boy, you must accept
us as your cousins.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
“My cousins!” Ivan repeated. “Ah, madame, how gladly!
But I must entreat of you to explain to me my good fortune.
It quite bewilders me.”</p>

<p>“I can explain very easily. Your mother, Victoire de
Talmont, was my husband’s much-loved cousin&mdash;nay, his sister
rather, for he was early left an orphan, and her father was
as a father to him. Her only brother, Louis de Talmont,
was as his brother, until that hateful revolutionary madness
seized upon him, bringing misery and disunion into the household.
It was her brother’s influence made Victoire give her
hand to his friend, the fascinating young Russian, Prince
Pojarsky. I cannot deny that this was a great sorrow to my
husband, for Prince Pojarsky had embraced the same opinions
as Louis de Talmont.”</p>

<p>“And did you know him, madame?” Ivan asked eagerly.
“Have you ever seen him?”</p>

<p>“I did not know him well. All this happened before my
own marriage. But I have seen him more than once&mdash;a fine,
brilliant young man, magnificent in dress and bearing, and
very handsome. You are like him; yet I think I see in you a
stronger resemblance to the features of Victoire.”</p>

<p>Madame de Talmont’s estimate of the young Russian prince
had not been very favourable, though she naturally and properly
expressed herself as kindly as she could in speaking to his
son. But Clémence had always beheld the half-mythical Victoire
robed from head to foot in shining garments, woven in
the loom of her own youthful romance. To see the son of
Victoire in the flesh seemed to be part of “the stuff that
dreams are made of” brought suddenly into the realities of
waking life. Breaking silence for the first time, she <span class="locked">asked,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Have you any portrait of your mother, monsieur?”</p>

<p>“I have never even seen one,” Ivan answered. “My father’s
ruin robbed me of everything. The poor mujiks who sheltered
me most kindly and most bravely&mdash;indeed at the peril of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
own lives&mdash;were unable to keep for me, out of all my father’s
wealth, even the smallest heirloom.”</p>

<p>“We have a likeness of our cousin Victoire, a pencil-sketch
from the hand of my father,” Clémence rejoined. “We must
show it to you, monsieur.”</p>

<p>Then Madame de Talmont made some inquiries about his
early history; and he answered modestly and with feeling. He
dwelt with much gratitude upon the kindness of his dear old
friend Petrovitch, saying in conclusion, “He taught me what a
good father might be like.”</p>

<p>At last it was necessary to say farewell. The ladies withdrew,
promising a speedy renewal of their intercourse.</p>

<p>“Would that I had a house of my own, even the humblest,”
said Madame de Talmont to Clémence, as they returned home;
“the son of Victoire should not lie ill another day in a public
hospital. Thy father loved her well, Clémence.”</p>

<p>Perhaps there was a shade on the brow of the widow as she
said this; but it was a tender shade&mdash;a long-past sorrow
touched and softened into the calm of resignation.</p>

<p>When they reached the house of Madame de Salgues, they
went at once to the parlour, where that lady always sat; for,
kindly and tolerant though she was, she would not readily
have forgiven them if a surprising piece of news had been kept
from her a moment longer than was necessary. They found
her, however, already engaged in hearing quite as much as was
good for her, perhaps rather more.</p>

<p>A lad, dressed in the uniform of the Ecole Polytechnique,
seemed to have brought a breath of modern air into the quaint
parlour, furnished as “petits appartements” used to be in the
days of Louis Quinze. Emile de Salgues was seated before a
table laden with every good thing in the shape of food that the
house contained. When the ladies entered he was dividing his
attention between two occupations equally fascinating. He
was exploring the depths of a Périgord pie, and driving his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
grandmother almost to distraction by a graphic account of the
exploits and perils of the Polytechnic scholars during the
defence of Paris.</p>

<p>Madame de Salgues was really slight and small, but enshrined
in her own particular fauteuil, and arrayed with
elaborate care in her antique brocades and laces, she looked
dignified and even stately, while her manners exactly suited her
surroundings, and seemed to lend them an added grace.</p>

<p>“Be seated, my dear Rose, and you too, Clémence,” she
said to her nieces as they entered. “You will both wish to
hear what Emile has just been telling me.”</p>

<p>Emile’s narrative did not flow quite so easily in the presence
of his cousins. He sometimes had a shrewd suspicion
that Madame de Talmont criticised and Clémence laughed at
him; though this was hardly correct, because Clémence in
those days had little heart to laugh. However, he resumed,
after due exchange of <span class="locked">greetings:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I was just telling my grandmother how we manned the
guns at the Barrière du Trône, and sent a point-blank discharge
into the midst of Count Pahlen’s hussars. Then they charged
us in flank; and, outnumbered though we were, I think I may
say we gave them enough to do. It was a glorious fight! But
as for myself, I thought my last hour was come. I was knocked
down in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mêlée</i>, and flung into a ditch. A gigantic Cossack
levelled his spear at my breast, and would have run me through
with it; but another Russian turned it aside, and I heard him
say, ‘Pas tuez le jeune Français.’”<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>“May God’s blessing rest upon that Russian, whoever he
was!” sighed Madame de Salgues.</p>

<p>“How is the Queen of Cities bearing her reverse of fortune?”
asked Madame de Talmont, after suitable comments upon
Emile’s perils and his gallantry.</p>

<p>“In no queenly fashion,” returned Emile, with an air of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
mortification, which, however, did not appear to spoil his
enjoyment of his grandmother’s delicate preserves. “The
truth is, I am ashamed of Paris. I am heartily glad <em>I</em> was
born in the provinces. The Parisians have no faith, no constancy,
no loyalty. Would you believe it?&mdash;nay, I suppose
you have heard it already, for ill news travels fast&mdash;they have
dragged down the Emperor’s statue from the top of the column
in the Place Vendôme; they have loaded it with the vilest of
insults, covered it with a sheet, put a rope round its neck&mdash;I
know not what besides.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the conquerors desired its removal,” suggested
Madame de Talmont.</p>

<p>“Quite the reverse. The whole column would have shared
the fate of the statue, but for a placard announcing that the
Allies had taken it under their protection. The conduct of the
mob has been unutterably base; and no whit better are the fine
gentlemen of Paris, while the fine ladies are infinitely worse.”</p>

<p>“Take care what you say, my dear grandson,” spoke
Madame de Salgues’ correct, quiet voice. “I could wish to see
you more chivalrous.”</p>

<p>“Chivalry would be wasted upon ladies who demean themselves
so far as to beg the gentlemen of the Emperor of Russia’s
suite to take them up on their horses, only that they may catch
a glimpse of him!”</p>

<p>Here Clémence interposed. “The ladies of Paris may not
be very dignified,” she said, “but at least they have not, like
the mob, incurred the reproach of inconstancy. Perhaps we
women are not always wise in our choice of an idol, or self-respecting
in the incense we burn before it; but at least we
seldom choose as the object of our idolatry a man capable of
leaving those who fought and bled for him to perish unpitied
in the snow, while he warmed himself at his fire in the
Tuileries, saying, in the satisfaction of his heart, ‘This is better
than Moscow.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Such an outburst from Clémence was rare indeed. It would
not have been possible, had not the newly-found balm of hope
taken the sting out of the old wound, and brought the Moscow
retreat within the category of things that could be spoken about.</p>

<p>“These are not the grounds upon which ladies form their
estimates of character,” Emile returned, a little superciliously.
“Oh no! When Napoleon wished to see a lady, he simply
ordered her to come to him. This Russian autocrat, in the
like case, sends his aide-de-camp to inquire whether madame
proposes remaining at home this afternoon, as, if so, he hopes
to have the pleasure of waiting upon her. After <em>that</em>, what
fair lady could suspend her judgment for a moment? Trust
the dear creatures, one and all, to prefer the finely-polished
pebble to the diamond in the rough.”</p>

<p>“Does the polish <em>prove</em> the pebble, or the roughness the diamond?”
asked Clémence demurely.</p>

<p>“The polish, at all events, takes with the multitude,” resumed
the indignant Emile. “High and low alike have gone
out of their senses about this Alexander. The canaille of St.
Antoine are as bad as the habitués of St. Germain. Every
word he utters flies from lip to lip, as if it were inspired.
‘Ah, sire, why did you not come to us before?’ ask the deputies
of the municipality. ‘It was the valour of your armies that
detained me,’ says Alexander; and all Paris is delighted. I
am bound to own he has kind words for all, and kind deeds as
well&mdash;so far.”</p>

<p>“There is but one question of absorbing interest for us, and
for France,” said Madame de Talmont. “Does he&mdash;do the
Allies intend to use their influence for the restoration of our
rightful king?”</p>

<p>“That I scarcely know,” said Emile. “I do know, however,
that the streets are full of white cockades; every hour one sees
more of them. And I hear that the Emperor of Russia and
the King of Prussia have been deep in consultation with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
old schemer Talleyrand, who, of course, is turning his coat again.
So, my dear grandmother, and you too, my cousins, I think
you may indulge a hope that the reign of the antediluvians is
about to recommence, and that Moses and Abraham and all the
rest of them may be shortly expected in Paris.”</p>

<p>Evidently Scripture history was not taught carefully at the
Ecole Polytechnique; still there was a strain of reason in the
boy’s random talk. It was as true of the men before the
Revolution as of those before the Flood, that “they ate, they
drank, they planted, they builded,” heedless of the rising tide
of divine and human wrath, until the torrent overflowed its
bounds and swept them all away. Would their successors do
the same?</p>

<p>“As for me, <em>I</em> am not one of your slight, inconstant time-servers,
ever ready to swim with the current and to turn
towards the rising sun,” Emile pursued, with a tragic air and a
sublime confusion of metaphors. “I can tell you, very little
more would make me go to Fontainebleau and lay my sword
and my life at the feet of the Emperor, the great Napoleon,
never more truly great than now, in the hour of his overthrow!”</p>

<p>“My <em>dear</em> boy!” Madame de Salgues interposed, in a voice
of agony.</p>

<p>“Let us suppose you do it,” said Clémence very quietly.
“Even such assistance would scarcely, at this stage, restore his
fallen fortunes; while you, on your part, would lose that
mathematical prize for which you have been trying so hard.”</p>

<p>Emile looked angry, and the heart of Clémence smote her.
She thought of the glow of enthusiasm with which the young
Russian said “<em>My Czar!</em>” and, after all, Emile’s hero-worship
too was sincere in its way.</p>

<p>“I think,” she resumed, “you have already discharged your
debt of honour to Napoleon. If all who swore allegiance to
him fought as you seem to have done at the Barrière du Trône,
the Allies would not be in Paris now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
The concession soothed his wounded vanity, and he started a
fresh subject.</p>

<p>“You have no idea what the city looks like,” he said. “To
walk down the Rue St. Honoré or along the Champs-Elysées
is as good an amusement as going to the play. All sorts of
strange beings, out of all nations under heaven, are riding
about. Cossacks in sheep-skin jackets, with sandy-coloured,
shaggy hair and beards, long lances, and queer little whips with
plaited thongs hanging on their necks; Calmuck Tartars, with
flat noses and little eyes; Bashkirs and Tungusians from
Siberia, carrying bows and arrows. Strangest of all and best
worth seeing are the Circassian nobles, in complete hauberks of
steel and bright conical helmets. Then there are countless
uniforms of a kind to which we are better accustomed, and
some of them very splendid,&mdash;jewelled orders glittering on the
breasts of the officers. All the Allies wear sprigs of box or
elm in their caps to distinguish them.&mdash;Clémence, you should
come into Paris and see the show. You really must do it. I
will take care of you,” he added magnanimously, and not perhaps
averse to the prestige it would give him amongst his school-fellows
to be seen escorting his beautiful cousin.</p>

<p>“My dear, you must not dream of such a thing!” cried
Madame de Salgues in great alarm. “A young lady to venture
into the midst of a city occupied by a hostile army! Who
ever heard of such a piece of insanity?”</p>

<p>“Grandmamma, the city is as quiet as if the allied sovereigns
had only come to pay us a visit of ceremony,” said Emile.
“The shops are driving a splendid trade; only I am afraid
our clever Parisians contrive to cheat the strangers outrageously.
The Rentes have risen already since the Occupation from
forty-five to seventy.” (Madame de Talmont and Clémence
exchanged glances of satisfaction.) “You could run no risk in
Paris, Clémence, unless it should come into your head to say a
word against the Emperor of Russia; and of that there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
danger, because ladies always take care to be in the fashion.
Dame Fashion herself has become a Russian just now. We
have bonbons à la Cosaque, bonnets à la Rostopchine, dinner
services adorned with pictures of the entry of the Allies, and I
know not what follies besides. But it is the most wonderful
triumph of Alexander that he is actually bringing into fashion
the very thing most scorned and laughed at in the Paris of our
days. Can you guess what I mean?”</p>

<p>“Good manners and decorum,” said Madame de Salgues.</p>

<p>“<em>Religion</em>,” said Madame de Talmont.</p>

<p>“You are right, ma cousine,” answered Emile. “Alexander
ascribes all his victories, not to his own skill or prowess, nor to
that of his army, but to Providence. Strange to say, his
followers do the same. Veteran officers scarred with wounds
and decorated with orders, and brilliant young guardsmen
evidently of the first fashion, hold the same language. They
tell you, apparently with the most naïve simplicity, that God,
not themselves, has done it all.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> Our Parisians, who for years
have scarcely uttered the name of God except to scoff at it,
find this piety delightful&mdash;for a change. But the clear-sighted
understand that this sort of language is dictated, if not by
policy, at least by a refined and delicate courtesy. They are
gentlemen, these Russians, and they adopt this tone to avoid
wounding our sensitive pride.”</p>

<p>“Do you then find it so much easier to believe in chivalrous
courtesy towards man than in piety towards God?” asked
Clémence.</p>

<p>Emile did not answer; and, after a pause, Madame de Talmont
<span class="locked">observed,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“But you said there were generous deeds as well as gracious
words. Those, after all, are the most reliable; and at least it is
pleasant to hear of them.”</p>

<p>“Then I have one to tell of, certainly upon a scale of imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
magnificence. Alexander has just restored to freedom&mdash;without
ransom and without conditions&mdash;all the Frenchmen
who are prisoners in Russia. It is said they number one
hundred and fifty thousand. They are to return immediately
to France.&mdash;How?&mdash;what is it, my cousins?&mdash;what has happened?”
It was no wonder he asked, for at his words Madame
de Talmont had fainted.</p>

<span class="smcap1 i">Ivan</span> recovered slowly from his severe and painful
wound. He had just risen from his bed one day,
and was sitting, pale and languid, near the table
trying to read, when he heard some one inquiring
for him. He had received frequent visits from his comrades
in the Guards, and from other friends in the army; but now
he turned gladly to welcome one whom he had not seen since
the night of the assault.</p>

<p>“Michael Ivanovitch!” he exclaimed; “I am delighted to
see you.”</p>

<p>Michael returned his greeting with respectful and affectionate
warmth, and they sat down to talk over all that had happened.
The change in Ivan’s appearance shocked and grieved his old
playfellow.</p>

<p>“You look so pale and worn, Barrinka,” he said. “Have
they been good to you here?”</p>

<p>“Most kind and good,” said Ivan. “I have had the best
of care and nursing. But oh, Michael, I have been longing to
tell you the luck the bandage brought me which you placed on
my wound. It was wonderful!” And he told the story of
his acquaintance with the De Talmonts. “Nothing can exceed
their kindness to me,” he said. “They insist upon my becoming
their guest&mdash;or rather, I suppose I should say, the guest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
of the aged relative with whom they live. They are good
enough to tell me she is eager to make my acquaintance. So I
go to them to-morrow; indeed, it was with difficulty I contrived
to put it off so long, but I could not bear to burden them with
a helpless invalid.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Barrinka, you make friends everywhere!”</p>

<p>“These friends were made for me, first by you, then by the
Czar, who has put all loyal Frenchmen under infinite obligations.
But tell me, Michael, what do you think of Paris? I
have not been there yet, you know.”</p>

<p>“Well, Barrinka,” said Michael meditatively, and with the
air of an old traveller, “I do not think much of it after all. I
would not compare it for a moment with St. Petersburg, not
to speak of holy Moscow. I never saw holy Moscow until just
before the fire,&mdash;and that was like seeing a lovely face with the
hand of death upon it,&mdash;but this city of the Frenchmen is nothing
to it&mdash;nothing! To what it <em>was</em>, I mean,” he added with a sigh.
“Where do you see anything like the great beautiful houses,
painted red and green and purple and yellow; like the roofs
of burnished lead, all shining as if they were on fire; like the
gilded domes and crosses on the tops of our churches? Napoleon
himself had the wit to admire them, and to know he
had nothing half so good in his own country, so he got the
dome of the Hôtel des Invalides gilt to look like one of ours,&mdash;a
Frenchman told me that himself.&mdash;Curse those Invalids!”
said Michael, with a sudden change of manner and a look of
gloom and ill-humour.</p>

<p>“And why so? What harm have the poor old fellows done
to you?” asked Ivan, half laughing.</p>

<p>“Great harm, Barrinka. Think of their having got hold of
our own Maria Ivanovka and taken her for themselves!”</p>

<p>“Your&mdash;<em>who?</em>”</p>

<p>“Our Maria Ivanovka, who was with us from the day we
left St. Petersburg until we entered this same city of Paris&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>which
is no great things of a city, as I shall always say. Poor
dear Maria Ivanovka! She may have been rather old,&mdash;I
don’t deny it,&mdash;and she <em>had</em> a droop in her upper lip, which
they say is a bad sign, besides being frayed about the mouth
in a sort of general way. But the Invalids will never love her
and take care of her as we used to do.”</p>

<p>A momentary stupefaction had fallen upon Ivan; he
wondered hazily whether Michael was speaking of a hospital
nurse or of a favourite sutler. But he prudently held his
peace, and Michael went on: “Before the war she used to
take care of the Winter Palace,&mdash;there are some that say she
stood in front of it for fifty years, but that I can’t believe.
However, not a fight have we had since we left St. Petersburg
that she has not borne a part in and done her business
<em>well</em>, though it is I who say it. At Leipzig her carriage was
broken; but we mended it with a cart wheel, which answered
famously.”</p>

<p>Ivan understood now. “You don’t mean to say,” he exclaimed,
laughing heartily, “that the Invalids have got your
gun! How came that about?”</p>

<p>“It is no laughing matter, Barrinka. They <em>have</em> got her;
and it was the Czar’s own doing. He went to see the poor old
Frenchmen, and found them sorely cast down and sorrowful,
breaking their hearts over their country’s disgrace and their
Emperor’s defeat.”</p>

<p>“That was natural,” Ivan interrupted. “Think what you
and I would have felt, Michael, had this war gone against us.
And if we were old and worn out, unable to strike a blow for
our country and our Czar, we would have felt it all the more.”</p>

<p>“The Czar seems to have thought like you, Barrinka; for
he spoke kindly to the poor old fellows, and tried to cheer
them. And when he found they were grieving over the loss
of their guns, the trophies of their old victories that they used
to be so proud of, he told them to be comforted; they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
have their trophies back again. The Allies had carried off
those guns of theirs when they came into the city, so what must
he do but send them twelve of ours, Maria Ivanovka being one
of them&mdash;to my sorrow.”</p>

<p>For a moment Ivan wondered silently, “Was there ever
such a knight in friendship or in war” as his Czar, Alexander
Paulovitch? Then he said: “I think you need not grudge
your gun to the poor old Frenchmen. Do you know how
many of their cannon they left behind in our country, for <em>us</em> to
show as trophies of what our arms&mdash;no, rather of what our
God has done?”</p>

<p>“No, Barrinka, I have never heard exactly; but I am sure
they must be many.”</p>

<p>“Not counting those they contrived to bury, or lost in the
rivers they passed over, we have captured of their cannon&mdash;nine
hundred and twenty and nine!”</p>

<p>“Great St. Nicholas!” cried Michael, lifting up his one
hand in amazement.</p>

<p>“Shall we not show our gratitude for this marvellous deliverance
by gentleness and kindness to our enemies, whom
God cares for, even as he does for us? That is what the Czar
thinks. He has refused to break down the bridge of Austerlitz,&mdash;a
standing monument of the old triumph of the French over
<em>us</em>,&mdash;or even to change its name. ‘It is enough,’ said he,
‘that I have passed over it with my armies.’”</p>

<p>“Can that be possible, Barrinka? Then no wonder every
one is saying now that the Czar is taking the part of Napoleon
and of his family.”</p>

<p>“And if he is? What is a brave man’s duty when a foe has
fallen? Should he not think, ‘How would <em>I</em> wish to be dealt
with if the case were mine?’ My friend Tolstoi tells me that
as the Czar was entering Paris in triumph, he looked up and
saw the statue of his great enemy on the top of the column in
the Place Vendôme. ‘If <em>I</em> had been placed so high,’ said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
‘my head would have been turned.’ Surely he was not thinking
of the lifeless statue on its pinnacle of stone, but of the
living man on the proud summit of this world’s dominion and
glory.”</p>

<p>“Barrinka, the Czar <em>is</em> there now, and his head is not
turned.”</p>

<p>“Thank God; for it is his grace that keeps him safe.
Michael, my friend, do you remember the oath we swore that
morning in the camp at Tarovtino, with the explosion still
sounding in our ears that laid half the Kremlin in ruins?”</p>

<p>Michael’s eyes kindled and his dark cheek glowed. “How
could I forget it, Barrinka?” he said. “Did we not swear to
take such vengeance on Napoleon and the French as the world
has never heard of yet? Woe is me! we have had the chance
and lost it.”</p>

<p>“Not lost it&mdash;used it nobly. Do you not see, Michael, that
the Czar has indeed taken such vengeance as the world never
heard of before? To comfort and help our enemies, to give
back good for evil, is not indeed the world’s way, but it is the
way of Christ; and perhaps in the end even the world may
come to see it is the best.”</p>

<p>The day after this conversation took place Ivan became the
guest of Madame de Salgues. It was a happy change for him.
Now, for the first time in his life, he was thrown into the society
of good, refined, and noble-hearted women. He enjoyed its
pleasures with keen appreciation; though, as it happened, the
beginning of his acquaintance with Madame de Salgues was
not particularly promising. When the ceremony of presentation
was over, the old lady began to compliment him upon the
magnanimity of his sovereign in restoring to France her rightful
monarch.</p>

<p>“Madame,” answered Ivan, who was anxious in his turn to
say something agreeable, “the Czar has only been desirous of
consulting the wishes of the French people. He and his Allies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
would have given their approbation to any settled government
the nation had been pleased to appoint, excepting that of
Napoleon or a member of his family. But Louis Dix-huit
appears to be the choice of France.”</p>

<p>Madame de Salgues stirred uneasily in her chair. “My
dear young friend,” she exclaimed in a slightly irritable
tone, “do you not see that is as much as to say that if a
man takes a purse of gold from the hands of a robber, he
is at liberty to give it to whom he pleases? Not so;&mdash;he
must restore it to its owner, else he himself is a robber
also.”</p>

<p>Ivan had a dim perception of the fact that France did not
belong to the Bourbons in at all the same sense that a purse of
gold belongs to its owner, but it was scarcely clear enough to
express in words; and had it been otherwise, courtesy would
have admonished him to decline an argument with his hostess.
So he dexterously changed the subject; and Madame de Salgues
afterwards observed to her niece, “That young man is certainly
very well bred, and a perfect gentleman. But I fear
his principles are rather unsettled. I hope he will not influence
Emile.”</p>

<p>Madame de Talmont could not suppress a quiet smile at the
idea of the scapegrace Emile suffering contamination from
Ivan. As days passed on, the young Russian proved a very
pleasant addition to the little household, and brightly and swiftly
the period of his convalescence glided by. When the weather
improved, he often sat in a summer-house in Madame de
Salgues’ little garden; and here the ladies would bring their
embroidery and bear him company, or comrades from the city
would come to visit him.</p>

<p>He had one visit from Michael, who was fêted and made
much of by the De Talmonts for Henri’s sake. He said afterwards
to Ivan, “Who would have thought French people
could be so good and gentle? May the Virgin bless the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
lady’s sweet face! If she would just get one of our priests
to baptize her into the true orthodox faith, I should like
well enough to see <em>you</em> lead her up the church, a little farther
than the font, Barrinka. I think she is almost good
enough.”</p>

<p>“Hold thy peace, Michael!” cried Ivan, half pleased, half
angry, and blushing deeply. “How little you understand! <em>I</em>
am not good enough to kiss her feet, or to take up the glove
she has dropped and give it back to her.”</p>

<p>At an early stage of their acquaintance Ivan discovered
Clémence’s little store of theological books, and asked leave to
study them. It was now nearly a year and a half since he
had begun to read his Bible with attention and interest; but
books about religion were still quite new to him. He began
their study eagerly, hoping to find a solution for some difficulties
which had occurred to him; but, instead of this, fresh perplexities
were awakened in his mind. He found that he had
plunged into a labyrinth of words and ideas absolutely strange
to him. It is true that the shallow scepticism of his youth
had long since given place to the only real belief he ever
knew. The flames of Moscow, the study of the New Testament,
the living faith of the man whom he supremely admired
and venerated, had been God’s way of leading him into a simple,
child-like dependence upon Himself, and a genuine desire to
serve and follow Him. But of the deeper mysteries of spiritual
experience he was still almost wholly ignorant.</p>

<p>One afternoon Madame de Salgues was slumbering in her
easy-chair, and Madame de Talmont had been called away; so
he found himself practically alone with Clémence. The opportunity
was too precious to be lost. He took from his pocket a
little book, “Les Pensées de Pascal,” which he had been studying
with deep and rather mystified attention. Showing her a
passage her own hand had marked carefully, line by line, he
<span class="locked">asked,&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
“Mademoiselle, what does that mean? I confess I cannot
understand it.”</p>

<p>She read&mdash;“‘I see my abyss of pride, of curiosity, of sin.
There is no connection between me and God, or the holy Jesus
Christ. But he has been made sin for me; by his wounds we
are healed. He has healed himself, and therefore assuredly he
will heal me. I must place my wounds upon his, must give
myself to him, and he will save me with himself.’”</p>

<p>Clémence paused a while. “I think it means,” she said at
last very reverently, “that the Lord Jesus Christ has taken
our sins upon him, and put himself in our place. We should
be quite overwhelmed when we come to see the ‘abyss’ of sin
that is within us, if we did not know he had done so. But he
has taken our sin and bound it about him like a robe, that we
may take his righteousness and stand before the Father robed
in that.” This, however, was a height beyond the range of her
own ordinary spiritual experience. So she added presently,
with an involuntary sigh, “<em>If</em> only we are numbered amongst
his redeemed.”</p>

<p>“It is very wonderful,” answered Ivan thoughtfully. “Of
course I always knew the blessed Lord died for our sins,” he
added, crossing himself; “but I never felt that there was any
‘abyss’ of sin within me. Do you think, mademoiselle, that one
must feel that in order to be really religious?”</p>

<p>“I think we cannot know the grace of Christ without knowing
our own sin,” Clémence answered. “But, monsieur, look
at these words also; I think you will find them easier to understand.”
She turned to another page of the book, and read&mdash;“‘Console
thyself; thou wouldst not be seeking Me, if I had
not already found thee.’”</p>

<p>Ivan pondered. “<em>Found thee?</em>” he repeated. “As the
shepherd in the gospel found the lost sheep? But perhaps the
sheep never knew how far he had wandered; certainly he never
was able to tell. That is a comfort. I like, too, to think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
one of the proverbs of my country: ‘The babe does not know
God, yet God loves it.’ But I fear I am deplorably ignorant,
and in every way very far from what I ought to be.”</p>

<p>It was not often that the talk of these young people glided
into channels so profound. The bright and varying experiences
that lay near the surface of their lives furnished far more frequently
the daily bread of their intercourse.</p>

<p>When Ivan grew stronger, his friends urged him to go and
see the wonders of Paris, which the elder ladies vaunted to him,
exerting all their powers of description to depict them in glowing
colours. They had of course already done the honours of
Versailles, with its splendid palace dedicated “to all the glories
of France.” Ivan was far too polite to tell them, as Michael
would have done, that he was sure Paris could not equal
Moscow before the conflagration; but he seemed less anxious
to see Paris than to bring his friends to see the Czar. At last
an expedition was arranged for an early day in May. A carriage
was engaged, in which Madame de Talmont, Clémence,
and Ivan were to drive together to the city, where Emile was
to meet them, and a long day of sight-seeing was to follow.</p>

<p>Ivan, all this time, was like one who floats dreamily on the
calm expanse of a tropic sea. Now and then a bright land-bird
skims by, or a blossom borne from afar sleeps on the surface of the
still, clear water. He is drawing near the shore of a new, undiscovered
country; but as yet he has not seen, has not dreamed of
it. His “eyes are holden,” until he feels the coral grate beneath
his keel; then suddenly he looks up&mdash;and behold, in one glorious
moment all is changed! Palm trees wave above him, green
grasses kiss the water’s edge, gorgeous plants trail their luxuriant
wealth of flowers, and for him there is a new world created.</p>

<span class="smcap1 t">The</span> day fixed upon for the expedition to Paris was
bright and sunny, with that delicious and undefinable
quality of exhilaration in the air which is
nature’s promise of summer hours to come. Such
days often make sorrowing hearts yet more sorrowful, because
the chords of hope and memory are intertwined, and no touch
is light enough to stir the one without at the same time awakening
the other. But the young and happy&mdash;those who are
looking before them, not behind&mdash;find in the vague gladness of
the world without the answer and the echo to voices equally
glad and vague in the world within them. Earth, air, and sky
alike seem to whisper, “Something good is coming. We know
what it is, but we may not tell it yet.”</p>

<p>Truly something good was coming to two young hearts that day;
nay, it had come already, only they themselves were not quite conscious
of it. The sharp eyes of the Polytechnic scholar discerned
some things which were perhaps not equally clear to those
more immediately concerned. Emile felt very angry with Ivan
for what he chose to consider his presumption, and he vowed inwardly
that, if he could, he would spoil his plans. It seemed a
kind of propitiatory sacrifice to his fallen idol Napoleon to disappoint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
and humiliate one of his conquerors&mdash;“ce coquin
russe,” as he called him in his heart. But he allowed nothing
of this to appear during the day; he was assiduous in performing
his duty of cicerone to the party, and anxious that Ivan
should miss no sight calculated to give him an exalted idea of
the glories and resources of France&mdash;least of all the Louvre,
then rich with the spoils of a vanquished continent.</p>

<p>He only permitted himself a slight touch of malice when Ivan
met one of his friends, and was told by him that they could not
see the Czar that day, as he had gone out to Malmaison. The
evident disappointment of Clémence piqued him almost as much
as it flattered Ivan.</p>

<p>“Never mind, ma cousine,” he said. “We will show you
the camp of the Cossacks in the Champs-Elysées&mdash;<em>that</em> is something
really worth seeing. It is true they are perfect savages,
ugly, uncouth, and unclean; but they are sufficiently amusing
for all that.”</p>

<p>Early in the day Ivan had observed the words, “Ici on dine
à la Russe,” on the window of a fashionable restaurant in the
Rue St. Honoré. He took Emile privately into counsel, saying,
“I should like to give our friends a genuine Russian
dinner;” and the lad, notwithstanding his private feelings, was
glad to assist in a plan that promised a little amusement to
himself. Accordingly, when the day was nearing its close, and
the eyes and limbs of the little party were thoroughly tired, no
one was very sorry to hear Emile say to <span class="locked">Ivan,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“This is the place where you wished me to order dinner,
Monsieur Posharky. I have carried out all your directions to
the best of my ability.”</p>

<p>But ere they could enter the glittering doors of the restaurant,
their attention was attracted by a little scene which was
passing on the crowded footpath of the fashionable street. A
gentleman whom Emile would have called old, Ivan middle-aged,
and Madame de Talmont in the prime of life, was bending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
in evident perplexity over a little girl, who was crying and
stamping her small foot in a vehement passion.</p>

<p>“Ma petite, ma chère fillette,” he was expostulating, “be
wise, I pray thee. Bethink thyself; all the world is gazing at
us. Come, come, my child, dry thine eyes. I will buy thee
a far handsomer brooch at the first jeweller’s shop I can
find.”</p>

<p>“But it will not have in it the hair of dear mamma,” sobbed
the child, a slight, black-eyed little girl of eleven or twelve.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Madame de Talmont recognized in the gentleman
an old friend, a political exile, who had doubtless accompanied
the stream of returning <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">émigrés</i> back to Paris.</p>

<p>“Can it be that I have the happiness of seeing once again
my dear old friend Monsieur de Sartines?” she interposed,
making a most welcome diversion; “and this&mdash;is this young
lady the little Stéphanie we used to know, whom I have so
often held in my arms? Monsieur de Sartines, here is my
daughter Clémence,” she added. “She too will have grown
almost beyond your remembrance.”</p>

<p>But Clémence was already making friends with the disconsolate
Stéphanie, listening to the story of the lost brooch, and
comforting her with a tact and gentleness which Ivan was
watching with admiring and delighted eyes.</p>

<p>Madame de Talmont soon remembered him, and presented
to M. de Sartines “Our young friend Monsieur Pojarsky, a
Russian, an officer in his Imperial Majesty’s Chevalier Guard.”</p>

<p>After the usual compliments, Ivan presented a request,
framed as gracefully as a Parisian could have done it, that
monsieur and mademoiselle would do him the honour to join
them at dinner. The proposal was found agreeable, and the
whole party adjourned to a handsome dining-hall, where a table
exquisitely adorned with baskets of rare fruit and vases of flowers
fully satisfied Ivan’s expectations. Nor did the repast that
followed disappoint the young Russian, jealous in the lightest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
matters for the credit of his country. The enterprising Parisian
restaurateur, having secured the services of a celebrated French
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chef de cuisine</i> whom the war had deprived of his lucrative situation
in the establishment of a Russian millionnaire, was able to
set before his numerous Russian guests just such a banquet as
would have awaited them at the table of a Tolstoi, a Narischkin,
a Dolgorouki.</p>

<p>The dinner went merrily forward. The names of the dishes
were strange, but their quality was unexceptionable. Amongst
other specialties, a delicate fish soup gained the approbation of
the party, although Ivan lamented that it could only be made
in perfection of the sterlet, not to be found anywhere except in
the waters of the Oka, the river near which he had spent his
childhood. Emile devoted himself assiduously to certain delicious
chicken cutlets called “Côtelettes à la Pojarsky” in honour
of Ivan’s heroic ancestor; although, when he heard the name, he
somewhat ungallantly sought to dissuade Clémence from partaking
of them. Rare wines, flavoured with peaches, apricots,
and prunes, accompanied the little banquet; and the fruits,
ices, and confectionery were voted perfectly “ravishing” by
Emile and Stéphanie, nor did any one dispute their verdict.</p>

<p>It would have been well if Ivan’s guests had been equally
harmonious upon other subjects. But it was impossible, in a
crisis like the present, not to talk of public events, and just as
impossible to talk of them without differences of opinion. The
party consisted of three ardent Legitimists, a Buonapartist,
a Russian devoted to his Czar, and a clever, observant child,
whose sole political creed as yet was that everything done in
the world ought to contribute to the amusement and gratification
of Stéphanie de Sartines.</p>

<p>Ivan’s ideas of politeness, perhaps a little overstrained, led
him to say everything he could think of in praise of Paris; and
M. de Sartines replied by a tribute to the magnanimity of the
conqueror, who spared the splendid city when it lay at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
mercy. “Your Emperor,” he said, “has shown himself generous
to his fallen enemies.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” replied Ivan, “my Czar has no fallen enemies.
With him the unfortunate ceases at once to be the enemy.”<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>“It has been a great disappointment to us,” said Madame de
Talmont, “that we failed to see him to-day.”</p>

<p>Emile had one of his small sharp darts in readiness for his
Royalist cousins. “It is not so easy to see the Emperor
Alexander since the return of Louis Dix-huit,” he said. “It
is no secret that the Bourbon is jealous of the Czar. In order
not to interfere with his most Christian Majesty’s ‘divine right’
to be the admired of all admirers in his own capital, Alexander
appears to efface himself. He even takes his daily walk at four
in the morning, before the ‘beau monde’ is astir and ready to
gaze at him.”</p>

<p>“Papa,” asked Stéphanie, “what is divine right?”</p>

<p>“Inhuman wrong,” said Emile under his breath.</p>

<p>“Try this iced pine-apple, mademoiselle,” interposed Ivan,
afraid of an argument. “It goes very well with these almond
biscuits.”</p>

<p>“This is the third or fourth time, I believe, that the Emperor
has gone to Malmaison,” said M. de Sartines a little stiffly.
“He is certainly very attentive to the ex-Empress Joséphine.”</p>

<p>“Her health is failing,” Ivan answered, “and no doubt her
heart is broken. In my boyhood I believed, with almost every
one about me, that Napoleon owed his successes to her. We
thought she possessed magical powers, and used to transform
herself into a white dove, that she might hear and impart to
him the counsels of his enemies. How amazed I would have
been had any one told me that Napoleon would abandon her;
and that the Czar, finding her forlorn and sorrowful, would, out
of chivalrous pity, plead for and comfort her!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
“Of all the bad actions of Napoleon’s bad life,” said M. de
Sartines with emphasis, “I believe his treatment of that woman
is the worst.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, monsieur,” said Ivan. “Still <em>I</em> can scarcely
think it, because I have never seen the ex-Empress, while I
<em>have</em> seen the miserable remains of the gallant army which he
abandoned so cruelly in the frozen plains of Lithuania.”</p>

<p>The next moment he was sorry for his words, for he caught
the angry glare in the eyes of Emile. Either he had not heard
or he had forgotten that the lad was an ardent admirer of
Buonaparte.</p>

<p>“The Emperor is fallen,” said Emile, “therefore, of course,
every one finds a stone to fling at him. He was not faultless,&mdash;I
grant it. You cannot expect real greatness to bind itself
down to the rules of a timid conventional morality. But at
least he was entirely free from petty vanities and small affectations.
You would never find <em>him</em> laying himself out to gain
the cheap praise of a magnanimous conqueror from the lips of
the vulgar.”</p>

<p>“<em>Never</em>, indeed,” assented Madame de Talmont.</p>

<p>“True, undoubtedly,” said M. de Sartines.</p>

<p>No one noticed Stéphanie’s aside: “I see; <em>very</em> clever people
need not care about being good. I shall tell my governess
that.”</p>

<p>But every one looked at Ivan. For a moment he grew perfectly
white with anger; then his face resumed its natural
colour, and a smile played about his lips. He said nothing, however,
and Emile went on: “Consequently he never overshot the
mark and made himself ridiculous, as I must say the Emperor
Alexander did the other day, when he actually admitted to his
own table, and spent hours in conversation with&mdash;whom do
you think, ladies?”</p>

<p>As neither Madame de Talmont nor Clémence replied, Stéphanie
felt herself called upon. “Perhaps the Director of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
Ecole Polytechnique, or&mdash;could it possibly have been one of the
boys?&mdash;<em>students</em>, I beg your pardon,” said she with a saucy glance
at Emile.</p>

<p>“My dear child,” said her father in a grieved and reproving
aside, “do not, I pray thee, try to act <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">l’enfant terrible</i>.”</p>

<p>Emile did not condescend to notice her, “No one greater,”
he resumed, “than the Abbé Sicard.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” asked M. de Sartines.</p>

<p>Madame de Talmont and Clémence knew very well, and
looked interested.</p>

<p>“An old fool of a priest who spends his life picking up deaf
and dumb children out of the streets, and teaching them to
read and to say their prayers,” replied Emile.</p>

<p>“How can they say their prayers if they are dumb?” queried
Stéphanie.</p>

<p>“They speak with their fingers, dear,” Clémence explained in
a lower tone. “I will tell you all about it another time. I
have seen a poor boy examined who was taught by the Abbé
Sicard. It was wonderful and beautiful. He knew far more
than many a child who could hear, and he <em>felt</em> what he knew.”</p>

<p>“His Imperial Majesty,” Emile was saying meanwhile,
“who has all the affairs of the world on his shoulders, and can
scarcely find time to be commonly courteous to the fair ladies
who adore him, found time enough to hear all the ‘methods,’
as they call them, of this fanatical priest; and has given him
the Order of St. Ladislaus, or St. Laocoon, or something.”</p>

<p>“The Order of St. Wladamir, you mean,” said Ivan very
quietly. “When the Czar returns home, he will probably
establish a school for the deaf and dumb in St. Petersburg, like
that of the Abbé Sicard here.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> I thank you for telling us all
this, M. Emile. Do you take liqueur? I can recommend this
curaçoa.”</p>

<p>“Curse his effrontery!” thought Emile. “Will nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
disconcert him? I will take another way with him, however.”</p>

<p>After the party rose from table, the De Talmonts had a short
walk to the place where the carriage was to meet them; and
their friends accompanied them. M. de Sartines gave his arm
to Madame de Talmont, and Stéphanie clung to Clémence, so
that Emile and Ivan were obliged to bring up the rear together,
not greatly to the satisfaction of the latter. To the former,
however, it was a precious and longed-for opportunity.</p>

<p>“M. de Sartines is a very well-bred sort of man,” he explained
to Ivan,&mdash;“though I, of course, am not fond of Legitimists
and believers in ‘divine right.’ It may be four or five
years now since he gave offence, in some way or other, to
Savary, the late superintendent of police, and was requested to
quit the Empire. He has just come back in the train of Louis
Dix-huit, with a great many more who are less wanted.&mdash;Peste!
the whole city is full of these white cockades; one would think
there was snow in May time.&mdash;I suppose that by this time <em>you</em>
know all the family affairs, M. Posharky, and they have told
you that long ago, before he left Paris, M. de Sartines was
betrothed to my cousin Clémence.”</p>

<p>Ivan’s sudden, irrepressible start, and the deadly paleness
that overspread his face, gave the keenest gratification to Emile.
“But he is so old, he might be her father,” he said at last.</p>

<p>“That does not matter in the least,” returned the spiteful
Emile. “He is an excellent <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">parti</i>&mdash;has a good property, settled
principles, and all that. Do you not see how devoted Clémence
is to that amiable and precocious young lady, Mademoiselle
Stéphanie? She will make an admirable step-mother; though
I cannot say I envy her the charge.”</p>

<p>“But, at the time you say it was arranged, Mademoiselle
Clémence must have been only a child.”</p>

<p>Emile looked at him keenly. “I fear your wound is sometimes
painful, even yet,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
“Yes, it hurts occasionally.&mdash;Is it then your custom here to
betroth children?”</p>

<p>“It is the custom for parents to arrange all these little
matters as they think best, and sometimes they arrange them
very early. Madame de Talmont, though she looks so gentle,
is a woman of most decided will, quite capable of settling the
destinies of all belonging to her. Ah, here is the carriage! I
am glad I have made your acquaintance, M. Posharky, and I
thank you for a very pleasant day.”</p>

<p>Ivan could not certainly return the compliment. The homeward
drive was rather silent; only a few remarks passed between
Madame de Talmont and her daughter. Ivan looked,
and was, exceedingly tired. Madame de Talmont observed this,
and kindly, even tenderly, expressed a hope that the fatigues
of the day had not been too much for him; nor did the eyes
of Clémence fail to express her concern, though her lips were
silent.</p>

<p>But all the time his resolve was taking shape and strengthening.
Emile’s tidings, while they touched him to the quick,
had also revealed him to himself. His path lay straight before
him now; he could do no less than</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Put his fortune to the touch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gain or lose it all.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">But the gain was so inconceivably precious, the loss so unutterably
terrible! A brave man may have the courage to risk
his all; yet he knows the extent of the risk, and it is no disgrace
to him if his heart trembles. That evening Ivan’s heart
trembled sorely; nay, it almost sank within him.</p>

<p>But a powerful ally was at hand. The door was opened for
the returning party by a young soldier in undress uniform.
There was a startled cry, an instant’s hesitation, and in another
moment Madame de Talmont was weeping in the arms of her
son, and Clémence standing beside them with a radiant face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
Ivan silently sought his lonely chamber; “for,” said he, “this
joy is one in which a stranger may not intermeddle.”</p>

<p>An hour later Henri bounded up the stairs, and knocked at
his door. “Supper is ready,” he said; “come, my friend, and
join us.” As they went down together he added, “It is one
joy the more for me to find <em>you</em> here, M. Pojarsky.”</p>

<p>While the happy family party sat together over the repast&mdash;almost
as unable now to eat for joy as they had been for sorrow
on the evening of Henri’s departure&mdash;their talk strayed lightly
over the surface of the eventful histories that had yet to be told
and heard.</p>

<p>“I must congratulate you upon your recovery, M. de Talmont,”
said Ivan.&mdash;“If you had seen him in the hospital at
Vilna, madame,” he added, turning to Madame de Talmont,
“you would rejoice and wonder at the change.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that well-remembered visit of yours!” returned Henri.
“In every way it was a happy one for me. Do you know
it has saved me a tedious and fruitless journey to Brie, and
a long delay in finding my mother and sister?”</p>

<p>“How could that be?”</p>

<p>“I arrived in Paris last night, very late. This morning I
chanced to see a young Russian gentleman in a uniform like
yours; so I accosted him, and asked for news of you.”</p>

<p>“How did you know my name?”</p>

<p>Henri smiled. “Naturally I wished to know to whom I was
indebted for so much kindness. So that day, after you left the
hospital, I asked those about me, and easily found out who you
were. Your comrade in the Chevalier Guard, whom I met this
morning, informed me that you had been wounded, and were
now at Versailles. Shall I tell you what he said besides?” he
added with a comical air of hesitation. “Just this&mdash;‘He is a
fortunate lad, born under a lucky star, and always sure to fall
upon his feet. At present he is the guest of a perfectly charming
family of the old noblesse, named De Talmont.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
“O Henri!” cried the half-blushing, half-laughing Clémence.
“I fear your residence abroad has not advanced you in the
grace of modesty.”</p>

<p>“I shall punish you for that speech by deepening your
blushes, sister mine,” returned Henri, laughing merrily. “For
my informant, M. Tolstoi, was good enough to add, ‘There are
two elder ladies of the most perfect grace and breeding; and a
demoiselle with a face beautiful as the Madonna’s, and no doubt
a soul that answers to her face.’ Of course after that I hastened
to inform him that the young lady was my sister, and to
beg for the address. So here I am.”</p>

<p>“But why did you not write to us during all this long weary
time?” asked his mother. “Why did you allow us to fear,
nay, to believe the worst?”</p>

<p>“I <em>did</em> write, dearest mother, from Vilna, no less than four
times; and you can imagine how I longed for one word in
reply, and how my heart sank as days and weeks and months
passed in silence. Of course I sent all my letters to Brie.”</p>

<p>“Then the lazy, dishonest, incompetent postmaster of Brie
ought to be ignominiously dismissed from his office, as no doubt
he would have been under the old régime,” said Madame de
Salgues, breaking silence almost for the first time. That night
she was taking, gladly and contentedly, the place of an interested
spectator of the drama of life, in which her own part
had been played long ago. If in the thankful little household
there still was one anxious and desponding heart, it was that of
Ivan&mdash;“the young heart hot and restless,” not “the old subdued
and slow.”</p>

<span class="smcap1 t">Three</span> or four days later, a solemn council met in
the parlour of Madame de Salgues to consider the
proposal for the hand of Clémence formally made
the previous evening by Ivan to Madame de Talmont.
The council consisted only of three persons&mdash;Madame
de Salgues, Madame de Talmont, and Henri&mdash;the two most
immediately concerned being, as a matter of course, excluded.
The Czar was expected in Versailles that day; and Ivan,
knowing that his only chance of a word from him was to be
found in placing himself once more amongst his wounded comrades,
had gone to the hospital. Clémence was in her own
chamber, on her knees, her hot face pressed down upon the
coverlet of her bed. Yet she was scarcely praying. The hopes,
the fears, the wishes that stirred timidly in the depths of her
heart were too vague to clothe themselves in words. Not even
into the ear of her mother could she have found voice to breathe
them; especially since the rigid conventionalities amidst which
she had been brought up forbade her to acknowledge that she
had hopes or fears or wishes at all. But kneeling there, she
felt herself in the presence of One who knew all, who understood
each subtle turn and winding of the heart that did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
half understand itself; and without too curiously examining
her burden, she tried to lay it, just as it was, at his feet. “Our
Father who art in heaven,” she pleaded, “do what is right and
best for me, and for&mdash;for <em>us all</em>. And thy will be done.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the voices in the room beneath her scarcely paused
for an instant. They were calm, well-bred voices, which never
interrupted each other, never grew too loud or hasty. But
they were the voices of speakers very much in earnest, and
with very definite views and opinions. It was with Madame
de Talmont that the decision really rested; but she felt it right
and fitting to consult the two others, though perhaps she only
did it, as persons of a quiet but determined character are apt
to do, with her own mind fully made up. “You are aware,
my dear aunt,” she said, “that the unhappy marriage of our
poor Cousin Victoire has created in my mind a strong prejudice
against Russians. But this feeling, though it may have its
weight with me, ought not to be decisive.”</p>

<p>Henri moved uneasily, and seemed about to speak, but
restrained himself, and Madame de Salgues inquired, “Does
this young man resemble his father?”</p>

<p>“In his figure, yes; and somewhat in his features also; but he
is far more like his mother. Victoire was charming; and I am
bound to acknowledge that everything I have observed in her son
since he came here creates the most favourable impression.”</p>

<p>“He certainly seems to be a perfect gentleman,” Madame de
Salgues admitted. “Un parfait honnête homme,” was what
she said.</p>

<p>“He is courteous, unselfish, generous,” Madame de Talmont
added. “His principles appear to be excellent; and although,
of course, I greatly deplore the difference of religion, and should
much prefer a Catholic, still I believe him to be really pious in
his own way, and very scrupulous in observing the rites of his
Church. Besides, as Clémence is herself so <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dévote</i>, I have little
doubt she will gain him in the end.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
“All you say is most true,” Henri assented warmly. “Dear
mother, if it be your wish to give the hand of my sister to an
honourable, noble-hearted, God-fearing man, I think you may
search the world without finding a better than Ivan Ivanovitch
Pojarsky.”</p>

<p>“The young man may deserve all you say of him,” Madame
de Salgues interposed rather sharply; “but in the meantime I
wish to know what are his prospects. What does he intend to
live upon?”</p>

<p>“He is an officer&mdash;an ensign in the Chevalier Guard,” remarked
Madame de Talmont.</p>

<p>“We all know that, my dear Rose,” returned the elder lady,
with just a shade of contempt in her quiet, well-bred accents;
“but we know equally well that his pay will scarcely keep him
in white kid gloves, tobacco, and pocket-money.”</p>

<p>“He does not use tobacco,” Henri threw in by way of
parenthesis.</p>

<p>“A place in such a corps may be a social distinction,” Madame
de Salgues continued, “but it is in no sense a provision. It
gives prestige, but it absorbs money.”</p>

<p>“I believe he has good expectations,” Madame de Talmont
hazarded.</p>

<p>“Good expectations!” the old lady scornfully repeated. “It
would be more to the purpose if he had a good estate. But it
appears his father was despoiled of everything, even to his
clothes and his jewellery. While as for the young man himself,
he has had half-a-dozen civil words from the Emperor of Russia.
That is absolutely all. I fail to see how he can set up an
establishment and do justice to a family upon <em>that</em>.”</p>

<p>“The Emperor, who is in full possession of all his history,
would not have placed him in the Chevalier Guard if he had
not intended to provide for him,” Henri said. “Do you know,
my dear mother,” he asked rather abruptly, “that M. Pojarsky
was in Moscow during the whole time of the Occupation?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
“I know he met you there; but how he came to be there
himself I do not know.”</p>

<p>“Just like him not to speak of it. I can tell you, however,
it was a piece of splendid gallantry from first to last. I heard
it talked of even at Vilna. M. Pojarsky, young as he then
was, stayed in the doomed city, at the peril of his life, to aid in
that terrible work of destruction, which will never be forgotten
while the world lasts. He helped to give Murat the warm
reception he got there; and he discovered some hundreds of
Russian wounded who lay concealed in the cellars, and must
have died of starvation but for the food with which he supplied
them. I am sure my honoured aunt and my dear mother will
both agree with me that these services have established a claim
upon his sovereign which no monarch would be likely to disregard,
least of all the Emperor Alexander.”</p>

<p>The force of this statement was admitted by Madame de
Salgues with half-reluctant candour, and by Madame de Talmont
with genuine satisfaction. Here the discussion ended,
though the conversation lasted some time longer. Finally it was
arranged that Ivan’s suit was to be favourably received, upon
an understanding that the marriage must on no account take
place until he had the prospect of an assured and permanent
competency.</p>

<p>No one had even alluded to what we should have thought
the most important element in the problem&mdash;the inclination of
Clémence herself. But what is unnamed is not necessarily
unconsidered. The heart of the mother beat in unison with
the heart of the child, although no words had passed between
them. There were tears in the eyes of Madame de
Talmont, but a thankful look in her quiet face, when at last
she rose and said, “Now I think I may go and speak with
Clémence.”</p>

<p>“Do so, dear mother,” said Henri, rising to open the door for
her. “But, I pray thee, do not detain her long. For I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
set my heart upon inducing her to walk with me as far as the
gate of the hospital, to see the Czar.”</p>

<p>“And what need of that, pray?” asked Madame de Salgues.
“I understand the Emperor of Russia is to pass through this
street on his way to the Castle. We shall all see him from
these windows. What more can any one desire?”</p>

<p>“Any one who had a sister as pretty as mine might very
well desire to take a walk with her in the town, when all
the world is making holiday,” returned Henri, laughing.</p>

<p>“Well, that is not so unreasonable. Young people of course
like a little pleasure; and the very best people&mdash;gens comme il
faut&mdash;will all be on foot in the streets to-day. But I trust, M.
Henri,” the old lady added more gravely as the two were left
alone together, “that you may never regret having thrown your
influence into the scale of this Russian. Even supposing the
young man to be the most desirable <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">parti</i> in the world, think
of the banishment from civilized society, and the frightful
climate of St. Petersburg! Clémence might have done better&mdash;much
better. Not to speak of M. de Cranfort, a very excellent
person, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bien rangé</i>, and with a sufficient property, who is a constant
visitor here, and I believe not indifferent to your sister,
there are others by no means to be despised.”</p>

<p>“I suspect M. Ivan has heard something of a certain M. de
Sartines which has disquieted him.”</p>

<p>“What can he have heard of <em>him</em>?”</p>

<p>“I do not know exactly; but the idea seems to have been
given that he aspires to the hand of Clémence.”</p>

<p>“Oh, as for <em>that</em>, it must be a mistake! M. de Sartines has
but just returned to Paris after an exile of several years. If in
former days he had any <em>penchant</em>, I believe it was&mdash;do not
laugh, Henri&mdash;for the mother, not the daughter. My own
ideas for Clémence&mdash;not that there is any use in expressing
them now&mdash;pointed, I must confess, in a different direction. I
am not rich, but these are evil days, and it is something to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
saved from the wreck of a fine fortune even so much as I have
contrived to do&mdash;for Emile.” A faint, delicate flush overspread
the furrowed cheeks of the old lady as she uttered the name she
loved best in the world, and added, with a little tender hesitation
that was almost touching, “I am very fond of your sister,
M. Henri.”</p>

<p>“I know it, ma tante,” said Henri, kissing her hand. “I
can never be half grateful enough for all your goodness to her,
and to my dear mother. But I am sure Clémence will be
happy, and that you are kind and generous enough to rejoice in
her happiness.”</p>

<p>He went to the door of his sister’s room, and knocked. After
a slight pause, his knock was answered by a gentle “Come in”
from Madame de Talmont. Mother and daughter stood together
at the window, and traces of tears were on both their faces.
Henri made his request that Clémence would accompany him
into the town; and Madame de Talmont, who did not like to
deny him anything, decided that she had better go. Clémence
would far rather have stayed at home; but she yielded, as usual,
to the wishes of her mother.</p>

<p>“Have you no dress but that one?” asked Henri with a little
hesitation, as he pointed to the plain black serge worn as
mourning for him, and which, in the three bright, bewildering
days that had passed since his return, she had been too much
occupied to think of discarding. “M. Ivan tells me that the
Czar noticed with sadness ‘the number of women and children
in mourning’ that he saw on the day of his triumphal entry into
Paris. Do not let him see one in mourning to-day who has
no cause to mourn.”</p>

<p>“I have <em>one</em> coloured dress,” said Clémence; and going to a
closet near at hand, she took out the purple brocade which her
mother had given her before Henri’s departure, and which she
had never worn.</p>

<p>“It will do very well,” said Madame de Talmont. “Already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
the story of <em>my</em> life is wrought into the pattern of those flowers.&mdash;And
now <em>thine</em>.”</p>

<p>Henri and Clémence were soon threading their way through
the crowded street, where the inhabitants of Versailles were
making holiday. The brother and sister seemed to have
changed positions, if not characters. Henri had passed
through such terrible suffering of body and mind, that although
the one might recover its strength and the other its
tone, still there was something gone from him which could
never return: he had left his youth behind him in the snows of
Russia. On the other hand, a fresh spring-time of life and hope
had come to Clémence; the garden of her sad and careful girlhood
was beginning to rejoice and blossom as the rose. As in
former days the grave and motherly elder sister had watched
over and counselled the careless, happy-hearted boy; so now it
became the office of the manly brother to protect and shield,
perhaps to advise, the young and timid maiden trembling on
the brink of the deeper joys of womanhood. Yet, though they
had much to talk of, at first few words passed between them.</p>

<p>“We are late,” Henri observed to Clémence, as he hurried
her along.&mdash;“Here they come!”</p>

<p>The Czar had already left the hospital, and the stately cavalcade
was advancing slowly down the street on its way to the
Avenue de Paris. “Let us come to these steps,” said Henri,
leading his sister quickly through the throng. “We shall see
well here.”</p>

<p>But the senses of Clémence were confused by the glittering
train as it passed along. “Where is the Czar?” she asked in
haste, making her voice heard with difficulty through the shouts
and cheering that filled the air.</p>

<p>“<em>There</em>&mdash;in green and gold&mdash;on the white horse.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I see him!” she cried, her eye following the direction
of Henri’s finger.</p>

<p>On either side of the Czar rode a handsome fair-haired boy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
and the bright young faces attracted for an instant the eye of
Clémence. “His sons?” she queried.</p>

<p>“Would they were,” answered Henri. “No, he is childless.
They are his young brothers, the Grand Dukes Nicholas and
Michael.”</p>

<p>But Clémence scarcely listened, so eager was she to see what
Ivan’s Czar was like.</p>

<p>The face was noble, but care-worn and weary, as of a man
who had heavy burdens to bear. Just then, however, he turned
towards one of the lads, bending his head to catch some laughing
remark of his, and a smile flashed like sunlight over his
features, revealing a rare and spiritual beauty unseen by her
before. She was satisfied.</p>

<p>Henri, meanwhile, was beside himself with excitement. He
took off his cap, waved it in the air, then taking advantage of
a momentary pause in the incessant and deafening cries of
“Vive Alexandre! Vive l’Empereur de Russie!” that filled
the street, he shouted aloud, in his clear, high-pitched voice,
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vive l’aide-de-camp de St. Priest!</i>”</p>

<p>Clémence gazed at her brother in amazement “What do
you mean? Who is the aide-de-camp de St. Priest?” she
whispered.</p>

<p>“He has heard! He understands! He is bowing to us!”
cried Henri, without heeding her. “God bless him! God
grant me one day to tell him what he has done for me. Or,
perhaps, <em>you</em> will tell him for me, Clémence?”</p>

<p>“Dear brother, let us come home. This crowd is too much
for you,” said Clémence in an anxious tone, as she saw his
rapidly changing colour and the tears that gathered in his eyes.</p>

<p>“No; it is all right. Thank God I have seen him once
again. When they have passed on I will take you home by
some quiet way, and tell you why I am so deeply moved.”</p>

<p>As he spoke they saw Ivan on horseback, amidst the group that
followed the Czar. He saluted them; and as he did so his face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
lighted up until it grew absolutely radiant with satisfaction.
“I told him,” whispered Henri, “that if he saw you here
wearing a coloured dress he might rejoice.”</p>

<p>“O Henri!” cried the horror-stricken Clémence, her face
overspread with blushes. “How wicked of you! What will
he think?”</p>

<p>“Nothing about <em>you</em>, sister mine. He knows you were not
in the plot; so be at rest. Now, let us come away; our work
is done.”</p>

<p>They found a quiet way through streets which were little
frequented at any time, and that day were absolutely empty.
Hitherto Henri had been very silent about the story of his life
since they parted; about all at least except the last year, which
he had spent very comfortably at Vilna, recruiting his health,
and enjoying the society of numerous friends amongst the Polish
nobility and gentry, who soon discovered in the young conscript
the scion of an old and good family. The allowance
generously given by the Czar to all the French prisoners sufficed
for his moderate wants;<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> and he had wisely devoted his leisure
to study. Thus much he had told to his mother and sister;
but the horrors of the Moscow campaign had been studiously
avoided. Now, however, as they walked slowly along, Henri
told his sister as much as he could tell any one of the “weltering
abysses of trouble” through which he had passed. He told of
the weary hungerings in the snow; of the Berezina agony; of
the dazed, half-delirious wanderings over the frozen Polish
plain; of the bitter, blank despair that settled down upon him
at last. He told of the ghastly Vilna hospital, the lowest
depth of all; and of the love, divine and human, which met
him there and rescued him from the pit of horror. “My feet
were set in a large place,” he said; “and I thanked God and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
believed in him as I had never done before.” He added, after
a pause, “And Ivan is the reflection of his Czar. Even unconsciously
and in the veriest trifles he copies him. Now, Clémence
you know another reason why I am not unwilling to trust the
dearest of sisters to his keeping.”</p>

<p>When the blush that passed over the face of Clémence had
subsided a little, she said softly, “No doubt you pray every
day for the Czar. So shall I.”</p>

<p>“I do; but it is hard to know what to ask for him. Already
God has given him everything we are wont to ask for rulers
of the earth&mdash;dominion, power, glory, wealth, victory over his
foes.”</p>

<p>“Let us ask God to give him his very best gifts, Henri.”</p>

<p>“Ay, if only we knew what they are.”</p>

<p>“We do know, brother,&mdash;love, joy, peace, long-suffering,
gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.”</p>

<p>Henri started, as though the thought were new to him.
“Those would be strange jewels for the diadem on a monarch’s
brow,” he said. “Yet, after all, the world&mdash;here in Paris as
well as where I have been in Poland&mdash;can bear witness to
‘long-suffering, gentleness, goodness.’ Of ‘love, joy, peace,’ of
course I cannot speak, for they are gems whose light is turned
God-wards.”</p>

<p>“Then let our prayer be for those. The face we have seen
to-day does not look joyful, Henri.”</p>

<p>When they returned to the house they found guests awaiting
them, friends of Madame de Salgues, who wished to congratulate
her niece upon the return of Henri, and to make his
acquaintance. The afternoon was spent in entertaining them,
and was already far gone when Ivan joined the party. Madame
de Talmont contrived to say a word to him in private, which
sent him with a beaming face to answer M. de Cranfort’s
multitudinous questions about the Dresden campaign.</p>

<p>By-and-by, when the soft May twilight had fallen, he stole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
to the window where Clémence was standing looking out on
the little garden. She had wearied of the discussion absorbing
all the others, about the time and manner of the new king’s
triumphal entry into his capital. Ivan in his heart thanked
the quick, eager voices which were making just then a welcome
“solitude for two.”</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle Clémence,” he began.</p>

<p>A thrill of terror swept over the girl’s heart, like the instinctive
shrinking of the sensitive plant which closes up its
petals at the lightest touch. She took refuge, not in silence,
but in speech. “Monsieur Ivan,” she said quickly, “I have
seen your Czar.”</p>

<p>“Have you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and heard Henri talk of him. There is a verse in the
Gospel of which he has taught me the meaning&mdash;‘He that
is greatest among you shall be your servant.’”</p>

<p>“How true! You always seem to go to the heart of everything.”
There was a pause sufficient for Ivan’s quick ear to
note that the pompous tones of M. de Cranfort were quite
filling the room. “Dear Mademoiselle Clémence,” he resumed,
“one little word from you can make me richer than the Czar
himself to-night.”</p>

<p>Clémence murmured something inaudible, and seemed to
need the hand he tried to take to shade her face, though the
room was in darkness now.</p>

<p>Then Ivan’s passionate heart flashed out and found its
utterance. Since the beginning of the world had no one ever
loved as he loved Clémence. It is the old fond illusion: to
each young and ardent soul its own experience is a new discovery,
undreamt of heretofore by the slow heart of humanity.

</div>

<p>But the moment’s rapture was all too brief. The vigilant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
eye of Madame de Talmont discerned a state of things which,
if suffered to continue, might possibly imperil “les convenances.”
She rose softly from her place and drew near, near
enough to catch the low-breathed words, “My Clémence.”
After one sigh&mdash;into which all the memories of her own youth
were gathered up&mdash;she laid her hand gently on the arm of
Clémence. “My dear child,” she said, “dost thou know that
the little Fanchon is very ill? La Tante will never be content
if she is not well cared for. Go and see.”</p>

<p>Fanchon was only a favourite lap-dog, but Clémence lavished
a good deal of tenderness that night on the little creature.</p>

<p>Three very happy weeks followed; then Ivan’s marching
orders came, and he set his face towards his own country, not
without sorrow, but with the hope of a glad return at no distant
day to claim the treasure left behind him.</p>

<span class="smcap1 t">The</span> bright spring-tide had ripened into a yet brighter
summer, when one day Clémence entered the
parlour where the two elder ladies sat at work.
Her cheeks were glowing, and she held in her
hand several closely-written sheets of paper. “Dear aunt and
dear mother,” she said, “I thought you would like me to read
for you part of the letter from&mdash;St. Petersburg.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear child,” answered Madame de Talmont tenderly.
“I am sorry Henri is not here. He was so anxious about it.”</p>

<p>Henri had gone to Brie, that he might bring to the sorrowing
family of his “true comrade,” Mathieu Féron, what comfort he
could&mdash;at least the mournful comfort of certainty.</p>

<p>Madame de Salgues motioned Clémence to a footstool near
her. “We shall be glad to hear of M. Pojarsky,” she said
kindly, but as if the kindness was not quite without an effort.</p>

<p>From the first sheet Clémence read scarcely anything. “He
says that his journey has been prosperous,” she explained in
general terms, “but that he feels a little solitary without&mdash;without
<em>us all</em>.” It must be owned that this was a very tame
and inadequate rendering of the eloquent original, which she
kept to herself. At length she began to read: “‘You will
remember our last expedition to Paris on the day of the king’s
triumphal entry, and Henri’s pleased surprise when he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
how completely the Czar kept himself and his Russians out of
sight, only mingling incognito with the crowd of spectators,
that none might say of the son of St. Louis, “Foreign bayonets
have brought him back to his capital.” You said to me then,
“Think what a welcome they will give him in St. Petersburg!
That will be a triumph to throw this one completely into the
shade!” And Henri added, “Would that I could see it!
But you must tell us all about it when you write.” I must&mdash;so
far as I can; but it would be impossible to paint the rapture
of enthusiasm, of loyalty, of gratitude with which his return
was awaited. Think of it! Russia not only delivered from
her enemies, but set upon a pinnacle of glory she had never
known before. In less than two short years, the invader
driven back from our capital to his own, stripped of the power
he had misused, and hurled from the throne he had disgraced.
France conquered, rescued, forgiven.’”</p>

<p>“If there is much more about the conquest of France, you
may pass it over,” said Madame de Salgues rather tartly. “Of
course, M. Pojarsky writes as a Russian.”</p>

<p>“The honour of France is dear&mdash;at least to some Russians,”
Clémence answered with a heightened colour. She went on:
“‘Three long days did the Senate spend in debating what
Russia should do to show her gratitude to the Czar Alexander
Paulovitch. Other princes had been given high-sounding titles,
had been styled in their life-time the Great, the Magnificent,
the Invincible, or, still more honourable, the Well-beloved&mdash;and
for him surely that would have been appropriate.
But some who knew the heart of our Czar spoke and said,
“Such titles would give the honour to himself alone; let us
find one which brings it back to God. That will please
him best.” “Blessed of Heaven” was the name chosen
at last. Would it not have sounded well in the long and
glorious line of our Czars, Alexander Paulovitch, the Blessed
of Heaven? Moreover, they planned to erect in St. Petersburg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
in the Isaac’s Square, a splendid monument, grander than
your column of the Place Vendôme, to celebrate his glory
and familiarize to every eye the names of his victories. They
sent a deputation proposing these things, and at the same time
praying him to accept the Grand Order of St. George, the
highest and rarest of our military distinctions; and to allow
them to organize&mdash;or rather to <em>permit</em>, for the people were but
too willing&mdash;public receptions, fêtes, illuminations, on the
most magnificent scale.</p>

<p>“‘I marvel, Clémence, whether you will be disappointed, as
I was, when you hear his answer. In no words but his own
can I tell it. This is what he wrote to the Senate: “I most
earnestly desire and implore the benediction of the Most High
upon the nation he has confided to me, that I may be blessed
by my dear and faithful subjects, and, if possible, by the whole
human race. But though I desire to attain this end, I
cannot flatter myself that I have attained it; nor can I permit
myself to accept this surname, for I should give the lie to my
own principles in offering my faithful subjects an example so
contrary to the sentiments of moderation and the spirit of
humility that I am endeavouring to inculcate. Therefore,
while expressing my deepest gratitude, I request the Senate to
regard these things as though they had never been. Raise a
monument for me in your hearts, as there is one for you in
mine. May my people bless me, even as I also bless them.
May Russia be happy, and may the Divine benediction rest
upon her and upon me.” “It is for posterity,” he said afterwards,
“to erect me a monument if they think me worthy of
it.” The Grand Order of St. George he declined to accept,
because it is only given to a general who has saved the country
from imminent danger, conducted a successful campaign, or
gained a great battle. He had not personally performed any
of these things, he said; though it may be that in this particular
posterity will not agree with him. “This arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>”
added he, “has done no more than another man’s.” As for
fêtes, illuminations, and processions, he requested most earnestly
that the money which would have been expended upon these
should be used for the succour of the widows and orphans
made by the war. To insure this as far as he could, he came
back to his capital, unannounced and unattended, some days
before he was expected. He went first to the Church of Kazan
to pray, then to the Winter Palace to see his mother. That
was all. Next day there was a solemn thanksgiving service in
the cathedral. I trust that to many of us it was no empty
ceremony, and that the words, “<em>Not us! not us! but His
name!</em>” went up from our hearts as well as from our lips.</p>

<p>“‘Yet I will own that at first I was disappointed&mdash;and that
<em>bitterly</em>&mdash;at the self-abnegation of my Czar. But now I am
more than content; I am rejoiced that he has put aside the
intoxicating cup that was borne to his lips. I am learning to
see more honour in humility than in monuments, decorations,
high-sounding titles.</p>

<p>“‘He intends soon to hold a levee for the especial benefit of
the officers who have been wounded during the war; and we
are invited, each of us, to state his wants and desires directly
to himself. I will not say that I long for this opportunity&mdash;nor
perhaps could I say it with truth. For I <em>trust</em>. I leave
with perfect confidence my future&mdash;<em>our</em> future, which is
infinitely more&mdash;in the hands of my God and of my sovereign.</p>

<p>“‘Yesterday I called upon General Soltikoff, who showed
me so much kindness two years ago. He looks greatly aged
and broken; indeed, I fear the days of mourning for the noble
old man are at hand. But he was kind and thoughtful as
ever. He told me he had just had the honour of presenting a
memorial to the Czar upon a matter which nearly concerned
me, but that at present he could say no more, as his Imperial
Majesty had expressed a wish to be himself my informant.
This has piqued my curiosity not a little, as you may readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
imagine. I conclude he will speak to me about it at the
levee.’”</p>

<p>This was as much of her letter as Clémence saw fit to read
aloud. One more paragraph may, however, be given here:
“My beloved, I read every day the little book you gave me.” (The
parting gifts of Clémence to her betrothed had been the sketch
of his mother pencilled by her father’s hand, and that treasury
of heavenward aspiration, so loved by devout and earnest souls
like hers, the “Imitation of Christ.”) “It is grand and
beautiful, but terrible to me. I feel more and more, as I read,
how full of sin, how utterly unworthy and vile I am&mdash;how far
from being wholly detached from the world and given up to
Christ. Then I go back to my Bible, and that makes me feel
my own unworthiness yet more deeply; but it also makes me
think of the love of God and the gentleness of Christ, and
thinking upon these I have hope. There are some words of
yours that often come to my mind. You said that the day
you saw me first, lying wounded in the hospital, you were
surprised and touched to hear me say I could not help rejoicing
in the triumph of my Czar, though <em>I</em> had no share in it. You
said it made you think that if you truly loved your King and
Saviour, you would be able even thus to rejoice in him, however
it might be with yourself. When I read his own good and gracious
words, and think what he is, and what he has done for us,
I seem to understand your meaning. But I am very ignorant;
and oh, how I need you to teach me&mdash;you, beloved, so much
wiser and better than I. I often marvel how you deigned to
care for me at all. I think it could not have come about had
not a ray of light reflected from my Czar fallen upon me.”
The letter did not by any means end there; but there may
fitly end the extracts presented to the general reader. Of
course many courteous and grateful messages to Madame de
Salgues, Madame de Talmont, and Henri found a place ere it
was concluded, and these were duly delivered by Clémence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
About a week afterwards another letter arrived, and Henri
had now returned to share its tidings. At first Clémence did
not read any part of it aloud; she only told its contents more
or less fully. Afterwards she read some portions of it to her
mother. It ran <span class="locked">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">St. Petersburg</span>, <em>Wednesday Night</em>.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Beloved</span>,&mdash;It is with a full heart&mdash;half glad, half
sorrowful&mdash;that I write to thee to-night. God has been good
to me&mdash;good beyond my utmost dreams; for has he not given
me <em>thee</em>? But in the sweetest cup some longed-for drop of
sweetness is still lacking; in the brightest life some brightness
is still wanting&mdash;some cherished wish ungranted. God
wills it so, and his will is best. Since my childhood a strong
untold longing has lain hidden in the depths of my heart.
Now I know it can never be fulfilled&mdash;never on this side of
the grave. The old hope, the hope of my boyhood and youth,
is gone from me. I cannot help these few tears which are
falling on the page as I write. But do not heed them; they
are not tears of bitterness&mdash;for I have been comforted. I am
going to tell you how.</p>

<p>“To-day the Imperial reception of which I told you was held
for the wounded officers. It was crowded. Amongst those
who were present I saw Count Rostopchine, to whom I shall
always feel grateful, because he was the first man who gave
me work to do, and bade me go and do it. He looks ill and
haggard. It is said he sees nothing day or night except the
flames of Moscow. The world gives him the credit of the
conflagration; and I cannot say that in this instance the world
is mistaken, although hitherto it has been the fashion here to
assume that it was done by the French. The count has made
himself very unpopular by his severities towards those who
were suspected of favouring the invaders, and it is not thought
that he will continue in office. He has nobly refused to accept
any compensation for his own enormous losses in the doomed city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
“I suppose I am writing all this just to make you a sharer in
my own long suspense and weary waiting. I thought my turn
for a word from my sovereign would never come, there were so
many present older than I. Besides, on such occasions his
Majesty never is in haste. He speaks to each: the words
perhaps are few, but they are so spoken that each feels that
his own particular case and circumstances are for the time
the sole objects of attention. But <em>my</em> five minutes came at
last, and proved enough to crown my long patience with an
abundant reward. A kindly question or two about my wound
was asked and answered; and then, without further preface,
the Emperor spoke to me of my father. He said that after
our first interview he had requested General Soltikoff to ascertain
whether he yet lived, and that, ‘during our absence,’ the
general had succeeded in obtaining full information about him.
‘He will give you the papers to-morrow,’ he added&mdash;and paused
for a moment. Something in his face told me my father was
no more, and almost unawares the words passed my lips, ‘He is
dead, sire.’ ‘I wish I could say you are mistaken,’ he answered.
‘All was different from what we thought. He was
never sent to Siberia. At his own earnest and impassioned
request&mdash;the request of a brave man&mdash;his punishment was
changed to that of compulsory service in the army as a private.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>
“Let me show my sovereign,” said he, “that although the
enemy of Louis of France, I am faithful to Catherine of
Russia.” Ivan Ivanovitch, he redeemed his word nobly, though
not to the Czarina. He was one of the many gallant men
whom I led to their death at Austerlitz, on the most unfortunate
day of my life.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> His regiment kept its place until
not a man was left unwounded. Will it comfort you to know
that he died a hero’s death, and that he died for me?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
“‘What more could I desire for him, or for myself?’ I said.
That was nearly all that passed between us. But it was
enough. I am comforted concerning my father.</p>

<p>“I cannot write or think of aught else just now. My dear
unknown father! So unfortunate! So young too&mdash;scarce
older, when the storm burst upon him, than I am now. What
agony he must have suffered! what desolation! Yet he kept
his sorely-tried loyalty without a taint; only craving, as his
last boon, leave to die for the sovereign who drove him from
her presence with insult, and doomed him to ruin and disgrace.
Surely his heart was true, whatever baseless, fantastic dreams
of liberty and equality may have set his brain on fire. The
Czar says he died a hero’s death, and that he died <em>for him</em>.
Thank God!</p>

<p>“My Clémence perhaps will wonder that I said nothing to
the Czar about our future&mdash;about my plans, hopes, or prospects.
Truly I had intended, if the opportunity offered, to
have spoken of these. But to-day I could not&mdash;I could think
of no subject save one. Forgive me this delay.</p>

<p>“It is late, but I am still sitting at my desk with that
precious sketch before me which your father’s hand transferred
to paper, and your hand placed in mine. My dear mother’s face
seems to look upon me and to say, ‘I too am comforted concerning
all I love. Here or elsewhere they are in God’s keeping.
Never, even in their darkest days, did he wholly take
away his loving-kindness from them.’</p>

<p>“To-morrow General Soltikoff is to tell me more. Not <em>much</em>
more, I suppose. Few particulars of the life and death of a
man degraded to the ranks are ever likely to be known. But
had <em>he</em> told me what I know now, how different everything
would have seemed to me to-night!</p>

<p>“Now it is not late, but early. That is really the light of
dawn, our Northern dawn, which is stealing in pale and faint.
I must put out my lamp and lie down, first thanking God for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
all his mercies, and praying him to keep me, and those a thousand
times dearer than myself, in the hollow of his hand.
Good-night,&mdash;my Clémence, my queen, good-night!”</p>

<p class="sigright">
“<i>Thursday Morning.</i>
</p>

<p>“I take my pen in haste to add a few lines which will
change everything for thee and me, Clémence. No, not <em>change</em>,
only clear away our perplexities, and make the crooked places
straight before us. My last night’s vigil made me rather a
late sleeper this morning, and I woke to find my servant
standing by my side, with a large packet in his hand bearing
the Imperial seal. You may be sure I lost no time in opening
it. Two separate parchments fell out&mdash;one the patent renewing
in my favour my father’s title of ‘Prince’ Pojarsky, the other
the title-deeds of his estate, Nicolofsky.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>“I cannot to-day write commonplace words about this; <em>you</em>
will read between the lines, and share the emotions that fill
my heart. Surely God has dealt well with me&mdash;infinitely better
than I deserve. It only remains now for estate, title, and all
else that I have and am, to be laid at your feet by your happy,
grateful, and devoted</p>

<span class="smcap1 a">Although</span> every real obstacle to his marriage was
now removed, it was several months before Ivan
found himself at liberty to return to France and
claim his bride. He had to go to Nicolofsky, to
see and set in order his new estate. It is impossible to describe
the joy of his old friends upon that occasion, and the welcome
he received from them all, especially from his foster-parents.
One of his earliest acts was to emancipate the starost and his
family, making them at the same time a present of their homestead.
He bestowed a similar favour upon the mother of
Michael; Michael himself, as a soldier, being free already. To
Pope Nikita and his wife he could give little that they cared
for, except kindness and sympathy. They had not recovered
from their deep sorrow for the melancholy fate of his old
playfellow, their beloved and only daughter. Amongst these
friends of his boyhood Ivan became once more a boy. He
would sit for hours talking to “bativshka” and to the company
gathered around his hospitable stove, telling them the eventful
story of the war, as well as his own adventures since they
parted.</p>

<p>He could not make this first visit a long one; although he
consoled his “serfs,” or rather his friends, with the promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
that at no distant period he would come again and take up his
abode amongst them. He was obliged to return to the capital
in time to accompany the Emperor to the Congress of Vienna,
where the brilliant series of fêtes and spectacles in which the
assembled sovereigns displayed their magnificence made the
presence of such a splendid corps as the Chevalier Guard particularly
suitable. But at length he succeeded in obtaining the
desired furlough, and early in February reached Versailles
once more.</p>

<p>He found Clémence unchanged, except that the months of
separation had added, in his eyes, to her grace and loveliness.
Madame de Talmont looked at least ten years younger since
the return of her son; but Henri himself seemed older, and
wore a grave if not a troubled aspect. Madame de Salgues
also was ageing quickly: Henri told Ivan she was anxious
about Emile, who had more than once been in danger for
acts of boyish insolence and bravado, such as tearing white
cockades from the breasts of their wearers, and giving a jovial
supper to his companions on the 21st of January, the anniversary
of the execution of Louis XVI.</p>

<p>“A wise government,” said Henri during a quiet walk with
Ivan in the park of Versailles, “would disregard these follies,
and a strong government could very well afford to do it. But
I fear the government of Louis Dix-huit is not either wise or
strong. He and his courtiers seem to forget that the world
has turned round more than once since 1789. There is not a
little discontent amongst the people, and there is much, very
much amongst the military.”</p>

<p>“Do <em>you</em> intend to embrace a military life, Henri?”</p>

<p>Henri shuddered. “<em>Never</em>, if I can help it. My experience
of soldiering was too terrible.”</p>

<p>“I do not think you need anticipate another Moscow campaign,”
returned Ivan.</p>

<p>“Still,” pursued Henri, “if my country were in danger, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
trust I should not be found lacking. My mother is exceedingly
anxious to see me in the army. But my own tastes lead me in
a direction quite different.”</p>

<p>“To the bar, perhaps, or the Church?”</p>

<p>“My mother and my aunt think these the only rational alternatives.
They talk grandly of ‘la noblesse de la robe;’ but I
confess I do not care for the career of a lawyer, nor do I think
I have the talents necessary to insure success in it. While as
for the Church,&mdash;may I speak my whole mind to you in confidence,
Prince Ivan?”</p>

<p>“Certainly you may, my dear friend.”</p>

<p>“I am a sincere and earnest believer in Christianity,” Henri
said. “I have heard the voice of God in the stormy wind and
tempest, in the snow and hail which fulfilled his will. But
since I have begun to study that will as revealed in his own
Word, a suspicion I cannot dismiss grows and strengthens
within me,&mdash;I fear some of the rites and doctrines of the
Church in which I have been brought up are not in accordance
with it.”</p>

<p>These words awakened for the first time in the mind of
Ivan the thought that any real or important divergence might
exist between the different forms of Christianity. Hitherto
the world for him had contained two classes only&mdash;believers
and infidels. These he found and expected to find everywhere&mdash;in
the “orthodox” Church of his own country, amongst the
Catholics of France and the Lutherans of Prussia. The idea
suggested by Henri was so new to him that he paused for some
moments to consider it before he answered, speaking slowly and
with deliberation, “I am sorry you are troubled with such
thoughts, Henri; for doubting keeps us from doing, and it
seems to me that there is a great deal to be done in the world,
and little time enough to do it. On the other hand, you would
not have the doubts if God had not sent them to you. You
are not doubting <em>him</em>; you are only doubting in what manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
you can serve him best. So you must face your doubts and
answer them, one way or the other. God will be with you,
and lead you to the light. But in the meantime you need not
sit idle.”</p>

<p>“True, most true. I am longing to work for God, who has
done so much for me. Besides, what right have I to sit with
folded hands, a burden upon my aunt? ‘If any man will not
work, neither shall he eat.’ But it is much easier to say what
I can’t do than what I can. My mother thinks so few things
possible to one who has the misfortune, as I feel disposed to
call it, of being nobly born.”</p>

<p>“What would you like to do, in your heart of hearts,
Henri?”</p>

<p>“If I tell you, will you laugh at me, Prince Ivan?”</p>

<p>“Not I! Why should I? When I was a boy I could plough
a straight furrow, and I was a fair hand with the reaping-hook.
You cannot fancy any occupation lowlier than these.”</p>

<p>“I should like to use, not a plough, but a pencil and pair of
compasses. At Vilna I lodged in the house of an architect,
and spent much of my leisure over his books. I was always
fond of mathematics, which are useful in that line. Prince
Ivan, if you want to build a palace on your new estate, I shall
be most happy to design it for you.”</p>

<p>Ivan made him a profound bow, then turned and laid his
hand on his shoulder. “Come to Russia with us,” he said
warmly. “Never was there a better opening for your genius.
Think of all Moscow to be rebuilt! Russia ought to be the El
Dorado of architects for twenty years to come.”</p>

<p>“Are you jesting, Prince Ivan?”</p>

<p>“Never was I more in earnest. The Czar will give you a
welcome; and the rather because he shares your tastes himself.
In his brief moments of leisure he often amuses himself by
taking up a pencil and drawing a design for a public building.
So he knows how to appreciate what is good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
“But&mdash;my mother. Already her heart is torn by the thought
of parting with Clémence.”</p>

<p>“Why need there be any parting? I think we could make
her happy at Nicolofsky or St. Petersburg. I have often thought
about this, and what you have said to me now gives me the
courage to propose it.”</p>

<p>“Do you intend to leave the army?” Henri asked in his turn,
perhaps with some desire to change a subject upon which he
was conscious of having said more than he intended.</p>

<p>“I do, as soon as peace is thoroughly settled. Of course,
until then it cannot be thought of. At the Congress things
sometimes looked doubtful enough.”</p>

<p>“That affair of the kingdom of Poland seems to be causing a
great deal of trouble,” said Henri. “More than it is worth, <em>I</em>
should say; but the Czar does not seem to think so.”</p>

<p>“When did <em>not</em> an old wrong cause an infinity of trouble to
the man who tries to repair it? By some strange fatality, it is
upon him the punishment generally comes, not upon the man
who did it,” Ivan answered. “Those ‘designs’ upon Poland,
for which many who ought to know better are now loudly
blaming the Czar, simply mean two things&mdash;to Russia an assured
peace, guaranteed by a strong, well-defended frontier; and to
Poland the longed-for ‘unity,’ with as much of the longed-for
‘independence’ as she is fit to have and capable of using.”<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>“It seems a strange way of repaying the Poles for having
gone away <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i> after Napoleon,” said Henri.</p>

<p>“It is the way of my Czar,” returned Ivan proudly. “Did
you ever hear what passed between him and Kosakoski, the
most devoted of Napoleon’s Polish adherents? ‘Is it true that
you followed Napoleon to Fontainebleau?’ asked the Czar.
‘Yes, sire,’ returned the Pole who certainly had the courage of
his opinions. ‘I was with him till he left it; and then, if he
had asked me to go with him, I would have done it.’ The Czar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
was silent for a moment, then he asked him, ‘What is it you
wish for most?’ ‘The restoration of my property,’ said Kosakoski.
The Czar immediately wrote an order to that effect, and
gave it to him. It is well known that his heart, since his boyhood,
has yearned to heal the wounds and to atone for the
wrongs of Poland. The Polish hostage, Czartoriski, was the
friend of his youth; and in their long confidential talks they
planned together to build the old waste places and gather the
scattered members of the oppressed nationality. Now Czartoriski
reproaches him with doing far too little; while Russia,
loyal but perplexed, suspects him of doing too much; and Europe
accuses him of caring for nothing but the extension of his own
frontier. And your King, Louis Dix-huit,” continued Ivan
with some bitterness, “to whom he gave a throne, treats him as
an enemy.” They had almost reached their home when this
was said, so Henri was spared the necessity of a rejoinder, nor
did he greatly care to make one, Legitimist though he was.</p>

<p>Many a happy talk had Clémence and Ivan in those days
about things past and future&mdash;things seen and unseen. Their
engagement was now openly avowed; the trousseau of the bride
was in preparation, and all was arranged except the wedding-day.
Madame de Salgues was becoming reconciled to an alliance
which would give her niece the title of Princess, and was lavish
in her presents of jewellery and costly laces. Since the Restoration
her life had become less secluded; many of the returned
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">émigrés</i> frequented her house, and found the young Russian
prince, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">futur</i> of Mademoiselle Clémence, a very pleasant
addition to their society.</p>

<p>One evening Madame de Salgues gave an entertainment to
a few of her friends. It was a supper, refined and elegant, but
unpretending, such as, in her own words, “used to be <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">de bon ton</i>
before the Revolution and the bourgeoisie spoiled everything,
when we did not come together to eat and to drink, but to converse
and to enjoy one another’s society.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
Upon this occasion her guests thoroughly fulfilled her expectations,
with the exception of the youngest of the party.
Stéphanie de Sartines, like a spoiled child, had importuned her
father to allow her to accept Madame de Salgues’s invitation;
but having gained her point, she sat absorbed and silent, refusing
to eat or to speak, and devoting herself to the contemplation
of her idolized friend Clémence, from whom she was so soon
to be separated. Ivan pitied the sad-faced little girl, and remembering
her exploits at their first meeting, sought to console
her with the most tempting of bonbons and preserved fruits;
but he could elicit nothing beyond a melancholy “No, thank
you, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“You should say M. le Prince, my daughter,” her father
corrected.</p>

<p>“En Russie tout faquin est prince,”<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> observed the audacious
Emile to his neighbour, M. de Cranfort.</p>

<p>The latter, though disposed to regard Ivan in the light of a
successful rival, resented the discourtesy of Emile, and showed
it by asking coldly, “What do you say, sir?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know the story? Before the war broke out the
Czar sent Prince Tufaquin as ambassador to the court of the
Emperor, who, during their first interview, called him nothing
but ‘Monsieur.’ One of the bystanders afterwards told him of
the title borne by the envoy. ‘J’ignorais qu’en Russie <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tout
faquin</i> est prince,’ was his answer.”</p>

<p>“General Buonaparte was a parvenu,” said M. de Cranfort;
“therefore it was not altogether his fault if he mistook rudeness
for wit.”</p>

<p>Emile “knew when he was beaten,” perhaps because he was
not an Englishman; so he turned from M. de Cranfort to
Stéphanie, whom he heard deploring that Prince Ivan was going
to take Clémence away from them into Russia, where she would
be frozen to death in the long cold winter, or eaten by the bears.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
He bent over her with a comic air of gallantry, and prayed her
to be comforted. “<em>I</em> am infinitely more devoted to you than
Mademoiselle Clémence could ever be,” he said; “and, mademoiselle,
<em>I</em> am not going to Russia.”</p>

<p>But he was scarcely more fortunate here. “Of course you
are not,” returned the young lady sharply, her dark eyes flashing.
“I heard a gentleman tell my father that the Czar is
inviting all manner of clever, capable people to go to Russia;
but for any one who is&mdash;who is, well, just <em>ordinary</em>, you know,
he has no particular welcome.”</p>

<p>In the meantime Stéphanie’s allusion to Russian bears had
occasioned remark. Ivan told some stories about them which
were rather amusing than terrible; for bears, like nobler
animals who run away when they are attacked, sometimes
make themselves ridiculous. Amidst the laughter which followed,
Madame de Salgues’s valet made a whispered communication&mdash;“Madame,
there is an old soldier without, who wishes
to speak with the young gentleman.”</p>

<p>“With what young gentleman?”</p>

<p>“The young gentleman of the house, he says, madame.”</p>

<p>“Then ask M. de Talmont to go to him at once, and see what
he wants,” said Madame de Salgues with a nervous air. The
capital and its environs swarmed with old soldiers of Napoleon,
who were needy and discontented, longing for any kind of
political change, and in the meantime, if report said true, not
always despising robbery and violence as less desirable but still
legitimate means of repairing their ruined fortunes.</p>

<p>Henri went into the hall, closing the door behind him. He
saw in the lamp-light a tall, gaunt figure, wrapped in an old
greatcoat, which covered a shabby uniform, but did not conceal
the cross and two medals glittering on the breast of the faded
tunic.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, monsieur,” said the soldier in a voice
Henri seemed to recognize. “It was not you I wished to see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
but the young gentleman who belongs to the Ecole Polytechnique.”</p>

<p>“Surely I know you&mdash;surely I have seen you somewhere,”
said Henri, looking attentively at the bronzed, weather-beaten
features of the old man.</p>

<p>The veteran shook his head. “You have the advantage of
me, monsieur,” he said.</p>

<p>But after another brief scrutiny a light flashed over the mind
of Henri, reflecting itself in his face. He advanced cordially
and took the soldier’s bony hand in his. “Pierre Rougeard of
the Old Guard,” he said, “I am heartily glad to see you. I
thought you were with the dead.”</p>

<p>It was natural that the young conscript should remember the
old Guardsman who had befriended him in his hour of need
far better than the Guardsman could remember the conscript.
Henri was greatly changed, while scarcely anything on this
side of the grave could change the hard, weather-beaten features
of Rougeard. He was obliged to recall the past to his recollection.
“Never,” said he, “did banquet seem so sweet to me as
that repast of horse-flesh to which you bade me welcome by
your bivouac fire on the Smolensko road. But we gave you
up for lost that terrible day before we crossed the Beresina.”</p>

<p>“I was made prisoner,” Rougeard answered. “But I fell
into good hands, and was kindly treated. At the Peace of Paris
I came home with the rest&mdash;though it is home no longer without
the Emperor,” he added with a sigh.</p>

<p>“You must have much to tell,” Henri rejoined; and as the
valet passed through the hall, he said to him, “Alphonse, this
is an old friend of mine who showed me much kindness while I
was in Russia. Take the best care you can of him. By-and-by,”
he said to Rougeard, “we will finish our conversation.”</p>

<p>He returned to the salon, and related what had passed to
Madame de Salgues. That lady, with the characteristic love of
a Frenchwoman for a little scene, must needs have the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
Guardsman brought in, that he might drink the health of Henri,
and receive the acknowledgments of his friends for the kindness
he had shown him.</p>

<p>So Henri fetched Rougeard, who listened to a little speech
from Madame de Salgues, had his hand shaken by Madame de
Talmont and Clémence, and emptied a brimming goblet of champagne
poured out for him by Emile.</p>

<p>As he gave back the goblet, he bent forward and whispered
a word or two, which made the lad&mdash;unused as he was to self-control&mdash;utter
an involuntary cry of amazement, and drop the
glass upon the ground.</p>

<p>Of course every one started and looked at him; and
Madame de Salgues asked in alarm, “What is the matter?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Emile in confusion, stooping to collect the
fragments of the broken glass.</p>

<p>“Nothing indeed,” repeated the terrible Stéphanie. “You
need not be alarmed, madame; I heard every word he said, and
it was only this, ‘<em>The little corporal has come back</em>.’ M. Emile,
who is the little corporal?”</p>

<p>Well might she ask the question, for “all faces gathered
blackness.” The party of friends, just before so glad and gay,
looked as if a shell had suddenly burst amongst them. M. de
Sartines was the first to find a voice. “Garde,” he said, turning
solemnly to Rougeard, “since you have spoken these words you
are bound to explain them. I daresay it is mere rumour,” he
added, addressing the ladies.</p>

<p>For a moment Rougeard stood irresolute. He had come to
impart his tidings to Emile, whom he knew already as an ardent
Buonapartist, ready to venture his life in the good cause; but to
proclaim them in the midst of a circle of Royalists had been far
from his intention. However, he soon recovered his composure.
To-morrow all Paris would know the truth; what did it matter
about a few hours? With a simple dignity which was not
unbecoming, he answered M. de Sartines, “I have the honour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
monsieur, to belong to the Old Guard, therefore I have heard
to-day what you will all hear to-morrow. The Emperor has set
his foot once more upon the soil of France. He has landed
near Fréjus, in the Gulf of St. Juan.”</p>

<p>“Then by this time he is a prisoner, if he is not shot, or
hanged upon the nearest tree,” said De Cranfort; while Emile
sprang to his feet, and shouted, “Vive Napoléon!”</p>

<p>“If my grandson cannot behave at my table like a gentleman,
I will thank him to leave it,” said Madame de Salgues with a
sternness that amazed every one, and was not without its effect
upon Emile, who was accustomed to nothing from her but extreme
indulgence.</p>

<p>Ivan, though his own thoughts were sufficiently sorrowful,
felt a compassion for the boy, and a dread, not altogether
groundless, of what he might be tempted to do if provoked.
Turning to his hostess, near whom he sat, he said to her, unheard
by the others, “Madame, I pray of you do not be hard with
him. Do not let him leave us in this way. His exclamation
was natural. I should certainly have done the same had I heard
the Czar was coming.”</p>

<p>Cranfort caught the last words, and said with petulance, “It
is all his fault.”</p>

<p>“Whose fault?” asked a quiet, elderly abbé, invited because
Madame de Salgues thought no party perfect without a slight,
a very slight ecclesiastical flavour.</p>

<p>“The fault of the Czar, M. l’Abbé,” returned Cranfort, raising
his voice, for the abbé sat at the other side of the table. “If
the Corsican adventurer succeeds in erecting his standard once
more, and torrents of blood are spilt, it will be the result of the
imprudent generosity of the Emperor Alexander. No one can
pretend that he was not warned. M. de Talleyrand and every
man of sense knew that Elba was no place for Buonaparte. It
was keeping a lighted candle at the door of the powder-magazine.”</p>

<p>“It did not require the wit of Talleyrand to find <em>that</em> out,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
said M. de Sartines. “The Emperor Alexander may have had
political motives of his own sufficient to explain his conduct.
Most probably he had. If not, his championship of the Buonapartes
does honour possibly to his heart, but little enough to
his understanding.”</p>

<p>Ivan was about to speak, but Henri, with a quick motion of
his hand, arrested him. “Not one word, Prince Ivan,” he said
in a voice low and tremulous with suppressed emotion. “Not
one word from your lips to-night! It is I&mdash;I whose life he
saved&mdash;who must defend him. And from what? Is it from
the charge of sparing the fallen? of being too generous, too
merciful, too trusting? There are very few who need exculpation
from such charges. And I, who but for that mercy of his
would now be lying in a nameless grave at Vilna, will not sit
by and hear them.&mdash;Messieurs, I am a man of peace; I hate
strife and bloodshed; and I thought that never again should
this right hand of mine touch sword or pistol. Yet I am ready,
either now or hereafter, with sword or pistol, or both, for any
gentleman, or any number of gentlemen, who may desire to meet
me in this quarrel.”</p>

<p>“Quel tapage!” muttered Emile. “One man may raise a
fine commotion where another may not breathe a word!”</p>

<p>Madame de Talmont was terrified by a vehemence so foreign
to the character of her son. She interposed, explaining that no
harm had been intended, and entreating him to recollect himself.
M. de Sartines also hastened to apologize. “I was not aware,
monsieur,” he said, “that you were under personal obligations
to the Czar. Still I cannot hold myself excused, for I should
not have used so much freedom in the presence of M. le Prince.
I hope he will be good enough to pardon me.”</p>

<p>“No need of that, monsieur,” returned Ivan. “The more freely
the conduct of my sovereign is discussed by every loyal Frenchman
the more will be his honour. The Czar,” he added proudly,
“has saved Europe once. If need be, he will do so again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
Shortly afterwards the guests departed. Henri drew Ivan
aside. “You will be obliged to leave us?” he said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Ivan answered gravely. “After what we have just
heard, I must go immediately to my Czar.”</p>

<p>Henri’s voice dropped still lower, and laying his hand on the
shoulder of his friend, he said a few earnest words. Ivan
answered in the same tone; then, with a countenance wonderfully
brightened, he left the room.</p>

<p>When he was gone, Henri said earnestly, turning to his
mother and his aunt, “Clémence and Ivan belong to each other
already in the sight of God; why should they not do so also
in the sight of man? Months, if not more, may elapse before
Ivan can return&mdash;a long and dangerous campaign, perhaps two,
may intervene&mdash;how much better a hasty marriage than the
wearing suspense and anxiety of a protracted engagement?”</p>

<p>“What difference can it make?” asked Madame de Salgues.
“Clémence must of course remain here until things are settled.”</p>

<p>“A very great difference,” Madame de Talmont answered.
“As a wife, he can send for her and she can go to him should
anything untoward happen&mdash;which God forbid,” she added with
a trembling lip. “God alone knows what comfort there is in
having the right to tend, or to mourn.&mdash;Henri, I entirely agree
with you.”</p>

<p>“It occurs to me that there is some one else whose consent
will have to be obtained,” Madame de Salgues observed.</p>

<p>Henri smiled. “I believe Ivan is this very moment engaged
in obtaining it,” he said.</p>

<p>“That being the case,” said Madame de Salgues, “and after
the opinion your mother has just expressed, it only remains for
us to arrange details.”</p>

<p>The next morning Clémence and Ivan were married quietly
in the parish church of Versailles. It is possible that the
young Russian gave a passing sigh of regret to the touching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
and beautiful ceremonies of his own ritual, which he was obliged
to forego. Gladly would “Ivan the servant of God” have been
“crowned with Clémence the handmaid of God,” as it is the
use and wont to do with brides and bridegrooms in the Greco-Russian
Church. But what did it signify? He was more
than content&mdash;he was unspeakably thankful for all that was
given him by God and by man.</p>

<p>There was a simple <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déjeûner</i>, the only guests outside the
family circle being M. de Sartines and Stéphanie, who was
greatly consoled by her dignity of bridesmaid. There were
brave, loving farewells; and then Ivan rode away to rejoin his
comrades and to do his duty in the conflicts that might yet
lie before him and them.</p>

<span class="smcap1 i">It</span> is amongst the minor yet very real troubles of life
that promptitude, courage, and self-denial so often
appear to be wasted. The call to action reaches
our ear: we spring up responsive, buckle on our
armour, and hasten to the front,&mdash;only to hear the bugles sounding
the retreat, and to find that the conflict has been adjourned
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sine die</i>. So it happened to Ivan. He was stopped on his
way to Vienna by tidings that the Chevalier Guard was now
in Poland with the main body of the Russian army. To
Poland accordingly he went; but only to linger in enforced
idleness day after day, even week after week, first at Wiasma,
and then at Prague. He could not dismiss the thought,&mdash;Might
he not just as well have spent all this time with his bride at
Versailles? He certainly might, except for the important consideration
that it can never be just as well for a man to neglect
his duty as to do it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the accounts from France added to his perplexity
and uneasiness. Napoleon, received everywhere with open
arms by the military, swept through the land like an unresisted
torrent, and on the 19th of March entered the capital once
more. Louis XVIII. abandoned it at his approach without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
striking a blow&mdash;a pusillanimity which made old Royalists like
De Sartines and De Cranfort hang their heads with shame. It
was natural that Ivan should feel the deepest anxiety about
the household at Versailles, and for the sake of those so dear
to him he could not be otherwise than thankful that a battle
had been avoided, although on more public grounds it grieved
him to the heart that Napoleon had succeeded so easily in
establishing himself once more in Paris.</p>

<p>During his stay in Prague, Ivan was cheered by a letter from
Clémence, bearing the impress of her own true, tender, and
courageous spirit. Henri wrote also, giving a more detailed
account of public events; and Emile contributed a version of
his own, which was by no means unwelcome. The student of
the Polytechnique wrote as though the entire glory of bringing
back the Emperor belonged to him and his schoolfellows; and
he exhorted Prince Ivan not to be in the least uneasy about
the family at Versailles, assuring him that they would enjoy
<em>his</em> powerful friendship and protection, with a naïve simplicity
that gave his correspondent a hearty laugh. “But after all,”
thought Ivan, “some atonement is due to the vanity of Emile,
which used to suffer so often from the keen though polished
thrusts of his Legitimist friends.”</p>

<p>All this time a burden of pain and apprehension lay heavy
on the heart of Ivan. It was probable that by the return of
Buonaparte from Elba, the great work of the Czar would be
undone; it was already certain that his expectations were frustrated
and his predictions falsified. He intended to do good,
and the good had become the occasion of evil. Every mouth
was opened now to reproach him with the untoward results of
his chivalrous kindness to the vanquished. “You see, sire,”
said Francis of Austria, “what has occurred in consequence of
your protection of the Liberals and the Buonapartists.” “We
are far,” said Talleyrand, “from accusing that greatness of soul
which treated a conquered Power almost like a conqueror; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
at least we cannot accuse ourselves of the imprudent generosity
we admired but could not prevent, though we have now become
the victims of it.” Doubtless Talleyrand only expressed the
sentiments of all the Royalists of France; yet it was as well for
him that he did not at that time fall in with the Emperor of
Russia’s Chevalier Guard. But infinitely worse to Alexander
than all these reproaches was the imminent prospect of another
great war, to water the soil of Europe with blood and tears,
and renew the horrors it had been the dearest wish of his heart
to terminate. Ivan was not surprised when a report reached
him that the Czar was ill at Vienna. He knew&mdash;he was not
likely ever to forget&mdash;that each remembrance of the useless
slaughter at Austerlitz touched the chords of a lasting sorrow.
He had heard of the terrible months of depression that followed
the murder of the Emperor Paul, when the attendants of the
new sovereign trembled for his reason or his life; nay, he himself
had witnessed a partial recurrence of the same depression
at the time of the death of Moreau. The sad face of his Czar,
as he had seen it then, haunted him day and night, and from
the very depths of his heart the cry went up to heaven, “O
God, uphold and comfort thy servant, who putteth his trust in
thee!”</p>

<p>At last the long-wished-for marching orders came, and the
early days of June saw the head-quarters of the Russian army
established in Heidelberg, under the personal command of the
Czar.</p>

<p>To the great joy of Ivan he looked well, and what surprised
him still more, instead of the expected depression, there was
such brightness in his countenance, such cheerfulness in his
whole demeanour, that he thought some specially good tidings
must have arrived. Meeting his friend Tolstoi, he asked him
if such were the case. But Tolstoi reported, on the authority
of his uncle the Grand Marshal, that there were no good tidings,
but rather the reverse. Matters, he said, looked very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
serious. It was to be feared the whole strength of the Allies
would be required to overthrow Napoleon, and a plan of
united action was being arranged amongst them. The Czar
was only anxious to do what was best for the general welfare,
and it was probable he would be called upon to make the first
attack; but time and place were as yet uncertain. “If I were
the Czar,” Tolstoi added indignantly, “I would see every Bourbon
of them all drowned in the Seine before I would stir a
finger to save them. You have heard of the practices of M.
Talleyrand&mdash;how the old fox induced King Louis to enter into
a secret treaty against us with the other Powers before the
return of Buonaparte, who found the precious document on a
table in the Tuileries, where it had been left behind by accident,
and sent it to the Czar, just to show him what sort of
friends he had.”</p>

<p>“No, I did not hear that,” said Ivan, keenly interested.
“Well, what did the Czar do?”</p>

<p>“Put it into the fire. ‘It is not <em>I</em> who am to be thought
of,’ he said, ‘but the peace of the world.’ I think, Prince
Ivan, something else will be thought of if we take Paris again
and M. de Talleyrand sees fit to stay there.”</p>

<p>Ivan had abundance of leisure at this time, some of which
he spent in wandering about the beautiful environs of Heidelberg,
looking at the picturesque old town from the “Angel’s
Meadow,” or watching the sun go down behind the shadowy
purple hills. He sometimes prolonged these rambles until late
in the evening, enjoying the solitude, for thought was busy
within him, and had endless materials upon which to work.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions he strayed into a hilly path,
secluded from general observation, and found that it led to a
cottage, in the window of which a light was placed. He drew
nearer, intending to ask his way; for he was surprised to find
himself in a place probably not more than a mile from the
town, and yet so entirely new to him. As he approached, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
was struck by the singular air of neatness which distinguished
a dwelling that in size and appearance was little more than a
labourer’s cabin. Presently he became aware that two or three
other persons were toiling up the pathway. An old man, with
a consumptive-looking girl leaning upon his arm, attracted his
attention, and after a courteous salutation, he inquired of him
in French, “Who lives yonder?”</p>

<p>“That is the dwelling of the French lady who speaks so
beautifully about our Lord Jesus Christ,” returned the old man
in the same language. “There is to be a prayer-meeting to-night,
and Adèle and I are going. Will you come too, monsieur?
It will do you no harm to remember your Creator in
the days of your youth.”</p>

<p>“I trust I do remember him,” said Ivan frankly; “but I
shall be glad to come in. I suppose you are all Catholics here?”</p>

<p>“The good French lady is a Catholic, but the young minister
who expounds the Scriptures and prays at the meetings is an
‘Evangelical,’ as they call it, from Switzerland. But they
both love the Lord Jesus Christ, and talk as if they had seen
him face to face.”</p>

<p>“Ay, indeed they do,” the girl said timidly. “They make
you feel him so near.”</p>

<p>The old man looked at her affectionately. “The visits of
Madame, and the little meetings in her cottage, have indeed
been new life to thee, my child,” he said.&mdash;“You cannot think,
monsieur, what a change there is in her&mdash;how much stronger
and better she is since these happy thoughts have come to us.”</p>

<p>“It is true,” the girl assented. “Last year I thought I was
dying; and oh, monsieur, the grave seemed so dark, so awful!
Now the fear of death is quite gone, thank God. Still I
think He means to let me stay here a little longer, and I am
glad&mdash;if it is his will.”</p>

<p>“Come, dear,” said her grandfather; “the door is open.&mdash;Come,
monsieur.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
Ivan hesitated. “Shall I be welcome?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, monsieur. There is a gentleman, the son-in-law of
Madame, I believe, who is always there, and another, a tall
and handsome officer, who is seldom absent. He seems to be a
devout soldier, like Cornelius of old. The rest are only friends&mdash;people
like ourselves.”</p>

<p>Ivan went in, took a seat on a bench beside his new friends,
crossed himself, and bowed his head for a moment in prayer,
then looked about him. It was now late, and the little room
was lighted, somewhat dimly, with candles of an ordinary kind.
Fortunately he was placed where he could clearly see the very
striking face and figure of the lady whom Adèle pointed out to
him with the one whispered word&mdash;“Madame.” Her hair was
silver, her face worn and haggard, with the look “of one that had
travailed sore.” Less than fifty she could not have been&mdash;Ivan
thought her much more; but hers had been one of those intense
and passionate lives which are measured “not by months and
years,” but by fears and hopes, by joys and sorrows, perhaps by
raptures and despairs. There was fire in her dark eyes, and
upon her pale and wasted features an expression at once of
dreamy mysticism and of ecstatic ardour. In youth she had
been very beautiful, but no mere physical beauty could survive
the storms that had swept over her. Yet some better thing
had come to her in place of her faded loveliness; so at least
they said who saw her when she spoke of that which was God’s
special gift and message to her soul&mdash;“the love of Christ which
passeth knowledge.” It was this secret whispered in her ear
that, in spite of many errors and some serious faults, made
Julie de Krudener a power for good in her day and generation.
She had this treasure in an earthen vessel&mdash;in one that was
flawed and well-nigh broken; but she had it, and gave of it to
others.</p>

<p>Though Ivan could read little of this in her face, yet he was
greatly struck by its expression. “She ought to be a sibyl or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
a prophetess,” he thought. The persons on either side of her
scarcely attracted his attention at all; they were her son-in-law,
the Baron de Berckheim, and a young Swiss pastor, whom
Adèle called M. Empaytaz.</p>

<p>Just as the clock in an adjoining apartment began to strike,
the door opened once more, and an officer of tall and commanding
aspect entered the room. He went quietly to what was
evidently his accustomed place, close to one of the lights, laid
a Bible which he had brought with him on the table, and sat
down. Ivan found it as much as he could do to suppress a cry
of amazement&mdash;for it was the Czar. But he held his peace,
and neither by look nor sign betrayed what he felt.</p>

<p>A prayer was offered, in which Ivan was far too bewildered
to join; he scarcely even observed that it was unlike any
prayer he had ever heard before, being extempore. Then the
young pastor opened his Bible, read a passage, and began to
expound it. But Ivan heard little; for he could not withdraw
his eyes from the Czar, who was listening intently to every
word, and who found and read every passage of Scripture
referred to, making constant use of the little eye-glass he always
carried in his sleeve.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>After some time, however, it occurred to Ivan that what
interested the Czar so deeply ought to interest him too. Surely
some mysterious power must dwell in the words which could thus
enchain a soul already filled with weighty cares, tremendous responsibilities,
soaring projects. Of what was the pastor speaking?</p>

<p>A sentence reached his ear that caught and held his thoughts,
making him also an absorbed and eager listener. It would not
be true to say that he forgot thenceforward the presence of the
Czar&mdash;<em>that</em> would have been impossible&mdash;but he felt it only as
an influence which added a conclusive weight of evidence and
a potent undefinable charm to all that was said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
The pastor’s theme was the forgiveness of sins, a subject now
full of interest for Ivan. He had long outgrown the stage of
spiritual life in which he said that he felt no “abyss” within
him. Prayer, study of the Scriptures, and intercourse with
Clémence had by this time taught him much of the hidden evil
of his own heart. Of his sins he could say now in uttermost
sincerity, “The remembrance of them is grievous unto me; the
burden of them is intolerable.” How he was to be relieved of
that burden had never been very clear to him. He knew that
pardon had come to mankind through Christ, and that it was
connected in some way with his death upon the cross; but how
it was to reach his own need, to avail for his own sin, he scarcely
knew. He supposed that he ought to read his Bible and to
pray, to repent truly, to obey God in all things, and to put his
whole trust in him; and this was what for some time past he
had been earnestly endeavouring to do.</p>

<p>But this new teacher, to whose voice his Czar was listening
with such reverence, spoke of the death of Christ as an atonement
not merely for the sins of the world, but for the special
transgressions of each and every believer in him. “I can say,”
he added, “to each one present here, ‘<em>Thy</em> sin was laid upon
him.’ Whoso believes in him, accepts the grace he offers, is
forgiven and justified through him. Such has, even now, everlasting
life, and cannot come into condemnation, but has passed
from death unto life.”</p>

<p>Ivan listened, wondering. Could this indeed be true? Might
it be possible for him to leave that room, not as he had entered
it, hoping, praying, longing to be one day forgiven and accepted
of God, but in actual present possession of that priceless boon?
This “glad evangel” would have seemed to him far too glad
to be anything more than a beautiful dream, had not the radiant
countenance of the Czar given the clearest evidence that <em>he</em>
believed it. When the lecture was concluded&mdash;and to Ivan it
seemed far too short&mdash;he hastened home to search his well-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>worn
Testament, and to find out, if he could, from its pages
whether these things were so.</p>

<p>After some hours of reading and prayer he reached the conclusion
that it was he himself who had hitherto been blind and
stupid. He marvelled that he had not earlier discovered what
now seemed to shine upon him from every page of the Book he
loved&mdash;the glorious truth of present forgiveness and acceptance
through faith in Christ. And thus that night one who had
hitherto only “believed” dimly and afar off “on the name
of the Son of God” came to “know that he had eternal life,”
and to “believe” consciously and fully “on the name of the
Son of God.”<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>A strange new joy burst upon his soul, flooding it with sunshine.
He knelt down and thanked God for teaching him this
truth. He could say now “<em>my</em> God” and “<em>my</em> Saviour.” He
knew now what was meant by those words of the apostle,
“Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God
through our Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>At length he rose from his knees, went to the window of his
apartment and looked out. The town clock had just struck the
second hour after midnight. The scene without was calm and
still, sleeping in the soft summer moonlight. It seemed to
Ivan a beautiful world, over which God was watching, and
which he had so loved as to send his Son to die for it. “To
die for <em>me</em>!” he said in his heart. “What can I do to show
my love and gratitude to him?”</p>

<p>As he stood looking out, a solitary figure passed down the
silent empty street. Ivan saw it was the Czar, who was only
then returning from the cottage on the hill. His attendants
were well accustomed to their master’s habit of taking long and
lonely walks, and his absence, even for many hours, would
occasion neither question nor remark. If, instead of communing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
with nature, he chose to spend the midnight hours in prayer
and study of the Scriptures, none need know it.</p>

<p>But Ivan suddenly remembered that a grand review of the
whole Imperial Guard was to take place that morning at six
o’clock, so he dismissed the idea of writing at once to tell Clémence
the wonders he had witnessed, and wisely threw himself
upon his pallet to snatch a few hours of necessary slumber.</p>

<p>When he came to the parade-ground in the morning he felt
like one bewildered. There, in the midst of his brilliant staff,
their uniforms glistening with gold and jewels, and the costly
trappings of their magnificent horses glancing in the sunlight,
stood the Czar, at once the centre and the heart of all that
martial pomp and pride. As Ivan, in his place in the Chevalier
Guard, advanced, retreated, wheeled to the right or the left,
in instant obedience to the word of command that issued from
those imperial lips, he wondered silently which was the dream&mdash;this
splendid pageant, or the scene last night in the lowly cottage;
but when he looked again upon the calm and joyous face
of the Czar he knew that both were real.</p>

<p>It was not until long afterwards that he heard the story of
how God had spoken to the heart of the Czar. Madame de
Krudener for some time past had been acquainted with the
Empress Elizabeth, and other persons belonging to the Russian
Court. What she heard from every one of the noble character
of Alexander awakened in her mind an intense desire to be of
use to him. “I have great things to say to him,” she wrote to
a friend; “for I have felt much upon his account. My business
is to be without fear and without reproach, his to be at
the feet of Christ.” Such impulses are sent from above.</p>

<p>It was late in the night of the 4th of June. Alexander sat in
his quarters at Heilbronn, depressed and weary, trying to read
a book of devotion, but unable to profit by what he read. He
had heard of the conversations of Madame de Krudener with
his wife, and the thought passed through his mind, “I wish she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
would come and talk to me.” At that moment his confidential
attendant, Volkonski, entered the room, and told him, with
much ill-humour, that there was a lady in the ante-chamber who
insisted upon seeing him, notwithstanding the lateness of the
hour.</p>

<p>“I cannot get rid of her, sire,” said the irritated aide-de-camp.</p>

<p>Alexander inquired her name.</p>

<p>“<i>Madame de Krudener.</i>”</p>

<p>“Ask her to come in,” said the Emperor. He afterwards
told a friend that he felt as though he were dreaming, so
strange did the coincidence appear to him.</p>

<p>Madame de Krudener entered. Certainly she did not fear
the face of man. She prophesied no smooth things to the
monarch of all the Russias. Perhaps she scarcely knew how
far God had led him already; for she told him, with uncompromising
boldness, that never yet had he come to the foot of
the cross with the prayer of the publican on his lips, and that
until he did so there could be neither pardon nor peace for him.
Much more she added, perhaps not altogether wisely; but since
she held up Christ and his cross before him, there was power in
her words to reach and to bless a heart which had been prepared
of the Lord to receive them. Seeing him affected even
to tears, she apologized for her boldness, and would have
paused, but he entreated her to go on. This proved the first
of numerous interviews.</p>

<p>Many a quiet talk over the Bible, prolonged into the hours
of the early morning, took place in the labourer’s cottage at
Heidelberg, where Madame de Krudener had established herself
in order to be near the Emperor. The young Swiss pastor,
Empaytaz, who shared in these conversations, has left a brief
record of them. One day he summoned courage to ask the
Emperor plainly, “Sire, have you now peace with God? Are
you assured of the pardon of your sins?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
Alexander was not a man who could hear or answer such a
question without emotion. For a time he was silent, apparently
questioning his own heart. Then “it seemed as if a dark veil
was lifted from his face,” and he looked up and answered,
“Yes, I am happy&mdash;I am very happy. I have peace, even the
peace of God. I am a great sinner; but since Madame”&mdash;glancing
towards Madame de Krudener, who was present&mdash;“has
shown me that Jesus came to seek and to save that which
was lost, I know and believe that my sins are pardoned. The
Word of God says that he who believes in the Son of God&mdash;in
God the Saviour&mdash;is passed from death unto life, and shall not
come into condemnation. I believe; yes, I have faith.” Two
words were at this time often on his lips&mdash;“I am very happy,”
and “I am a great sinner.” They supplied the double key-note
of his inner life. His joy in the forgiving Christ kept pace
with his sorrow for the sins that had grieved him; the one
grew and deepened in the same proportion as the other.</p>

<p>Years afterwards he said to a friend&mdash;tracing his conversion,
it is interesting to observe, not merely to his conversations
with Madame de Krudener, but to the whole course of God’s
dealings with him from the time of the burning of Moscow&mdash;“Since
then I have known God as the Holy Scriptures have
revealed him. Then I learned to understand, and I understand
now, his will and his law; and the resolution to consecrate to
him only, and to his glory, my life and my reign has ripened
and strengthened within me. Since then I have become another
man; to the deliverance of Europe from her ruin I owe my own
salvation and deliverance. It is only since Christianity has
become important above all things else to me, since faith in the
Redeemer has been manifested in me, that his peace&mdash;for which
I thank God&mdash;has entered into my soul. Ah, but I did not
arrive there at once: the path by which I was led stretched
across many a conflict and many a doubt.”</p>

<p>It was no wonder that now he found it less difficult than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
ever to pardon his enemies. It seemed to him something
which he could not help doing, because he had been himself
forgiven. “Why should I do otherwise?” he said, when
Madame de Krudener expressed her surprise at some act of
forgiveness extraordinary even <em>for him</em>; “have I not the
gospel in my heart? I know only <em>that</em>; and I think that if
any one were to compel me to go a mile with him, I should
willingly go with him twain.” So glad was his heart in those
early days of faith and love.</p>

<p>God had given this man the seventh part of the habitable
globe to rule over. He had given him the splendour of a
throne, the wealth of an imperial treasury, the command of
mighty armaments. He had given him even more&mdash;victory
over all his foes, success in all his undertakings; at this time
nothing that he sought to accomplish was denied him. Yet the
man’s deep heart was still unsatisfied. “All these things were
too little” for him. One thing he desired of the Lord, that he
sought after&mdash;“to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire
in his temple.” That also God gave him. The brightest glory,
the “crowning mercy” of Alexander’s life, was no earthly
triumph, no victory in war or diplomacy; it was that God
answered him in the joy of his heart, and enabled him to say,
with the poorest and humblest of his believing children, “My
Father, my Saviour.” The secret of the Lord was with him,
and He showed him His covenant.</p>

<span class="smcap1 a"><span class="epubonly">“</span>A great</span> battle! Napoleon is annihilated! Wellington
and the English have done it!” Such
was the cry with which Tolstoi rushed breathless
into the guard-room where Ivan and others were
sitting. The tidings were not wholly unexpected, and yet they
came with startling swiftness and suddenness. Only a few
days before had Napoleon disclosed his real design, and poured
his troops into Belgium. So rapidly had this movement been
effected, that while Wellington was actually engaged in writing
to the Czar to arrange a plan for an offensive campaign, the
French had advanced upon the British and Prussian cantonments,
and the firing had begun. Wellington’s letter was dated
the 15th of June, and by the evening of the 18th&mdash;one of the
most momentous days in the world’s history&mdash;Napoleon was a
ruined and despairing fugitive.</p>

<p>It was only natural if, after the first outburst of exulting joy
at the overthrow of the common enemy, the Russians remembered
Moscow and the glories of the German campaigns,
and said sadly each to the other, “Ah, why were not we
there?”</p>

<p>“I do not grudge the English their laurels,” said the captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
of the Chevalier Guard. “They are a gallant race, and have
been true throughout to the cause of Europe and of freedom.
But why were not <em>we</em> at hand, instead of Blucher and those
Prussians, to stand by them breast to breast?”</p>

<p>“We can only say, captain, it was the will of God,” answered
Ivan. “He sent the English and the Prussians to Belgium, and
kept us here. He knows&mdash;and all the world knows too&mdash;that
the Czar was as ready for the work as Wellington or Blucher,
and would have done it quite as well.”</p>

<p>The Czar himself recognized in this event the hand of God,
and was satisfied. He had learned a lesson perhaps more difficult
than that of being ready to do any work required of him&mdash;he
was “ready <em>not</em> to do.” Without an afterthought of
jealousy he saw the work he had begun completed by another,
to whom was given the crowning glory of dealing the fatal
blow to the enemy <em>he</em> had first grappled with and overthrown.
The heart-felt joy with which he gave thanks for the victory of
Waterloo was deepened by the thought that the blood of his
Russians, shed so freely before in the cause of Europe, had now
been mercifully spared.</p>

<p>Three weeks afterwards the allied sovereigns entered Paris
once more, and Louis Dix-huit returned in their wake. A
second time had the way to his capital been made safe for him
by his “dear friends the enemies,” as he sarcastically and ungratefully
styled his deliverers.</p>

<p>The Chevalier Guard attended their imperial master, and Ivan
had the intense joy of a reunion with his young bride. His
return was far more speedy than they had either of them dared
to hope, and their hearts were filled with thankfulness. Madame
de Salgues had removed from Versailles into the city, where
she had taken a small house in a fashionable quarter, and Ivan
obtained permission to reside with his friends.</p>

<p>Many things had happened during his absence; he had much
to hear as well as to tell. The “Hundred Days” had left their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
impress upon all the household. Madame de Salgues told him
she had come to Paris as much from a determination to defy
“General Buonaparte” as from a sense of the insecurity of a
town like Versailles in such troublous times. Henri, strange
to say, had reaped advantage from the general confusion.
When the power of Napoleon was re-established, Madame de
Talmont deplored that the army, as a career for her son, was of
course out of the question; and Henri thought this a favourable
moment for broaching the ideas he had already uttered in confidence
to Ivan. They were received much better than he had
ventured to expect; and he was now, with his mother’s consent,
studying under a celebrated architect. “One must sometimes
sacrifice one’s feelings,” she said, “though <em>never</em> one’s
principles. And, after all, what to do? The army is no longer
a place for a man of honour; the bar you do not like; and to
the Church there is at least one objection,&mdash;I do not wish the
noble name of Talmont to die with you.”</p>

<p>Emile was now a resident under the roof of his grandmother;
he had ceased to wear the uniform of the Ecole Polytechnique.
With a few other students who made their imperialism very
obtrusive during the Hundred Days, he had the honour of
sharing in the downfall of his hero by being expelled at the
return of the Bourbons. This ended not only his military and
scientific education, but, at least for the present, his hopes of
obtaining a commission.</p>

<p>A day or two after his arrival, Ivan inquired for M. de Sartines
and his daughter, whom he had not yet seen.</p>

<p>“No doubt they will be here to-morrow,” Madame de Salgues
answered. “They know you are with us. Besides, we are
their near neighbours now, and they seldom leave us three
days without a visit.”</p>

<p>“Wish they would leave us three weeks!” said Emile.
“That little girl is a perfect nuisance.”</p>

<p>“My dear boy, how very ungallant you are!” Madame de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
Salgues observed. “Still,” she added, “I must own that
Mademoiselle Stéphanie is not by any means improved.”</p>

<p>“Not altogether <em>her</em> fault, poor child!” put in Clémence.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>you</em> always speak for her, ma cousine, because she is
like your shadow,” said Emile. “Three mornings in the week,
at least, Prince Ivan, she comes here. ‘Papa,’ she says,” and
the lad imitated the little girl’s tones&mdash;“‘papa will allow me to
go to the Tuileries gardens, or the Champs Elysées, or the
Louvre, if Mademoiselle Clémence will be so kind as to accompany
me.’ She has not even the grace to say, ‘Madame la
Princesse.’ But now <em>you</em> have come, we shall have an end of
all that.”</p>

<p>“Then I am to understand,” said Ivan, greatly amused,
“that the deterioration in Mademoiselle Stéphanie’s character
is owing to her intercourse with Clémence?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” returned Emile laughing.</p>

<p>“There are those about her,” said Madame de Talmont more
gravely, “who encourage and applaud her pert speeches; and
that, to a child, is absolute cruelty.”</p>

<p>“Who <em>did</em> encourage them during the Hundred Days, you
mean to say,” Emile resumed. “While the Emperor was in
power, you were all of you glad to hear, even from the lips of
a child, whom no one could punish or seriously blame, the impertinences
the grown-up Legitimists were longing to utter, but
dared not.”</p>

<p>“Some of us,” said Madame de Salgues with dignity, “never
condescended to conceal our opinions. You will do me the
justice to remember, Emile, that I gave to every one, as my
chief reason for coming into Paris, my desire to show the usurper
I was not afraid of him.”</p>

<p>“As if the Emperor&mdash;” Emile began indignantly, but fortunately
checked himself in time, and turned off his annoyance
with a laugh. “You forget, my dear grandmother,” he said,
“that there was another reason yet more potent. The truth is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
Prince Ivan, we came into town to avoid that poor M. de Cranfort.
Since the auspicious morning when my cousin became
Madame la Princesse, the unfortunate gentleman has not been
quite in possession of his senses. It is reported that he carries
two loaded pistols about with him, and threatens to shoot first
Clémence and then himself.”</p>

<p>Every one present laughed heartily, assuring Ivan there was
not a word of truth in the story.</p>

<p>“As much, I suppose,” said Ivan in a low voice to Emile,
“as in another story you told me once&mdash;about M. de Sartines.”</p>

<p>“I am glad enough now <em>that</em> was false,” Emile answered
graciously. “That child would have been the death of Clémence.
I hope M. de Sartines, if he does marry, will marry a dragon,
able to keep her in order. But really,” he added, “M. de Cranfort
is not quite sane. I have heard him say the most extraordinary
things; and, do you know, he was for some years at
Charenton?” After a short pause, he resumed suddenly&mdash;“Prince
Ivan, how is the Emperor Alexander?”</p>

<p>“In excellent health,” said Ivan cheerfully.</p>

<p>“I am truly rejoiced to hear it.”</p>

<p>“Very kind of you,” returned Ivan smiling, but with a slight
air of surprise at his emphatic manner.</p>

<p>“Because,” resumed Emile, in a tone of mystery, “as we are
all friends here, I may observe that we have heard rumours&mdash;extraordinary
rumours.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean about his illness at Vienna? It is true he
had a fall from his horse, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>that</em> is nothing. That is not what I mean. But the
strangest things are said of him here, and in the best circles too,
where you know he was adored last year. In the Faubourg St.
Germain all sorts of ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">on dits</i>’ are rife about him. People say
he has become very singular,&mdash;a fanatic, a pietist, and I know
not what else; that a certain crazy old lady&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hush, hush, Emile,” said Madame de Salgues and Madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
de Talmont almost at the same moment. Clémence looked
anxiously at Ivan, and Henri started up indignantly. “I, at
least, will not stay to listen to such folly,” he said.</p>

<p>“A truce, for once, to your championship of the Czar,” said
Emile. “I suppose Prince Ivan may speak now.”</p>

<p>Ivan might have answered angrily, but for certain words
which thrilled through his heart, taking all the bitterness out of
Emile’s reckless taunts: “Esteeming the reproach of Christ
greater riches than the treasures of Egypt”&mdash;only <em>he</em> said “the
treasures of <em>Russia</em>,” and the magnificent crown jewels he had
seen in St. Petersburg flashed before his eyes in a dazzling,
bewildering maze of light and colour. For a moment he did
not speak; then he asked, with a gentleness that surprised every
one, “What were you going to say, Emile?”</p>

<p>“Nothing&mdash;at least not much,” was the rather apologetic
answer. “Rumour always exaggerates things, and most
especially the rumour of St. Germain. Perhaps it is <em>not</em> true,
after all, that Madame de Krudener makes the Emperor Alexander
fast and wear sackcloth; or that she has persuaded him
he is the white angel of peace, and Napoleon the black demon
of war; or that&mdash;but, as I say, these may be foolish stories.
Still it seems to be undeniable that the consummate artist, who
last year played the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> of magnanimous conqueror with such
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">éclat</i> amongst us, is now assuming, by way of variety, that of
medieval saint. Henri Quatre is masquerading in the guise
of St. Louis. Seriously,&mdash;what has come over him, Prince
Pojarsky? Is his mind really affected, or is it all some deep-laid
political scheme?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Emile, I am amazed at your audacity,” Madame
de Salgues interposed again. “Prince Ivan has the patience of
a saint.”</p>

<p>“From <em>your</em> lips, madame,” said Ivan bowing, “I accept the
name as a compliment; though others, it seems, use it for a
reproach.&mdash;Emile, I am not careful to answer you in this matter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
You have but to watch the course of events, and you will see
that there is not a man in Europe of sounder understanding
than my Czar. Of what he has already accomplished I need
not remind you; and I had rather not, considering <em>whom</em> he
has overcome. If his religious principles expose him to reproach,
it is only ‘the reproach of the foolish.’ They are not new to
him, though of late they have deepened and strengthened. All
those stories you allude to about his intercourse with Madame
de Krudener are fabrications. The grain of truth they contain
is the fact that God has been pleased to send him a message
by the lips of a woman;&mdash;and why should he not?”</p>

<p>To this there was no answer, and the little party broke up.
But Ivan drew Emile aside. “I want a word with you,” he said.
“Do you know in what temper the minds of men are now?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean the minds of Royalists?” asked Emile bitterly.
“That I do. I believe that if they had the power they would
put every Imperialist of us all to the sword; or if not, it would
only be to reserve us for the dungeon and the scaffold. The
Bourbons gnash their teeth upon us. The Duchess of Angoulême
says openly, ‘Mercy cannot be distinguished from weakness.’”</p>

<p>“Ah, my friend, can you wonder? When that stern, sorrow-stricken
woman had a girl’s tender heart, it was turned to stone
by the cruel murder of both her parents and of her young innocent
brother. But others who have not the same wrongs to
avenge are quite as eager for vengeance.”</p>

<p>“They are a bad set, those Bourbons,” said Emile.</p>

<p>“Certainly <em>I</em> shall not plead for them. They have not used
us or our Emperor well. But consider that in the eyes of a
German every Frenchman is as odious as a Buonapartist can be
in those of a Royalist. The Prussians talk openly of dismembering
France; and, Emile, who is to hinder them? Not Louis&mdash;he
is powerless; not Austria&mdash;she will share the spoils; not
England&mdash;she is just, and even generous, but do you expect her
to go to war single-handed in the cause of her enemies?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
“<em>One</em> man would have hindered them,” said Emile&mdash;“he who
is a captive now. France will soon wish the Emperor back
again.”</p>

<p>“I respect your faith in your hero, though I do not share it.
But, my dear Emile, you cannot deny that, however it has come
to pass, the most stupendous genius of modern times has proved,
practically, the most stupendous failure.”</p>

<p>“Is success always the test of greatness?”</p>

<p>“By no means. But Napoleon has always acted as though
it were; has aimed at it, lived for it, sacrificed everything to it,
and finally lost it. As he has now left&mdash;been forced to leave&mdash;his
country to the deadly enemies his ambition has raised up
against her, what will the end be, Emile?”</p>

<p>“Who can tell? As for me, I feel ready to hang myself.”</p>

<p>“Pray for the life and health of my Czar. You will see him
stand between the avengers and their prey; between prostrate
France and victorious Germany; and even, so far as becomes a
foreigner, between prostrate Imperialists and victorious Royalists.”</p>

<p>“That it should come to this! That France&mdash;our proud,
glorious France&mdash;should have to thank a Czar of Russia!”</p>

<p>“Where is the shame of thanking him, if God has given him
the power to befriend her?”</p>

<p>“<em>God?</em>” Emile repeated scornfully. “That’s your way of
talking, you Russians. Don’t you see now that it ends in folly
and fanaticism?”</p>

<p>Ivan laid his hand on the shoulder of Emile. “My dear
boy,” he said, “do you know why I am talking with you
thus? Not to make you believe in my Czar. <em>His</em> glory is in
good keeping; and if you prefer Napoleon for a hero, I have no
more to say. The cause I want to plead with you is not his,
but your own. You call him fanatic and dreamer because of
his faith in God and in Christ. I want to show you that it is
this very faith which makes him generous, merciful, just.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
“I do not see the good of faith,” Emile broke in passionately.
“I don’t mean <em>religious</em> faith, but faith of any kind. We had
faith&mdash;oh, such intense, glorious, undoubting faith&mdash;in the
Emperor and in his star. And we loved him so! You cannot
understand it, Prince Ivan, but it is true. Do you remember
Henri’s friend, the Old ‘Garde’ Rougeard, who came to tell me
of the Emperor’s return? He fell at Waterloo; a comrade of
his, who crept back wounded to die amongst his children, told
me about it. When all was lost, the remnant of the Old Guard
was called upon to surrender. ‘La Garde meurt, mais ne se
rend pas,’ was the proud reply; and those brave men died
where they stood.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> Poor Rougeard took the colours from the
falling ensign, and with his dying hand wrapped them round his
breast. ‘Vive l’Empereur!’ was his last word.”</p>

<p>“And the Emperor lived, <em>after</em> such followers as these,” said
Ivan with tears in his eyes. Emile saw the tears, and they did
him more good than a hundred admonitions. Ivan presently
resumed: “Suppose, Emile, that when your Emperor dies some
one were to try to persuade the world that he had never existed,&mdash;that
his whole personality, life, and career was a fiction
from first to last?”</p>

<p>“Any one who tried it would be laughed at for his pains.”</p>

<p>“Of course. Every effect must have a cause. Men do not
love, trust in, die for that which is not, and never has been.”</p>

<p>“What are you trying to say?” asked Emile, a little surprised.</p>

<p>“That the existence of Christ is as certain as that of Napoleon.”</p>

<p>“Was. There was once such a Person, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“<em>He is.</em> In the year three thousand six hundred&mdash;if the
world last so long&mdash;who do you think will die for the name of
Napoleon Buonaparte? Who will love him, obey him, follow
him as my Czar on his throne to-day is not ashamed to confess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
that he loves and follows <em>his King</em>? Nay, even the glory of my
Czar will pass away, the jewels that sparkle in his crown
of fame will pale and wane (<em>that</em> will not matter, for he
will have cast it long ere then at his Redeemer’s feet); but the
glory of Christ will last for ever and ever.”</p>

<p>“I know you really believe in the Christian religion. I cannot,
but I respect those who can.”</p>

<p>“I believe in <em>Christ</em>, Emile; and I want you to believe in him
too. I want you to search and look, and never rest until you
find out&mdash;first that he is, then that he is worthy of all your
faith and love.”</p>

<p>“Where do you want me to look?”</p>

<p>“If you will, at the lives of those who profess this faith. See
if it does not produce better and nobler results than any other
principle of action. But I had far rather you looked at the picture
of Christ himself as you will find it in the holy Scriptures.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will try,” said Emile, evidently touched. “At
least I can read. I have more than time enough for reading
now. I study mathematics with Henri; but he is <em>so</em> tiresome
that every lesson ends in a quarrel.&mdash;Last term I had the
second prize at the Polytechnic, and now I expected the first.
Was it not hard to be turned out?”</p>

<p>“Very; but you have the consolation of suffering in the
cause of your Emperor. If I were you, Emile, I would study
hard enough to show the world I was no loser. And, one word
more; I would keep away from political meetings, <em>secret</em> meetings
especially, and eschew plots and intrigues. They are only snares
and pitfalls dug for the feet of those who cling to a lost cause.”</p>

<p>“Lost!&mdash;Oh, Prince Ivan!”</p>

<p>“My friend, Napoleon has played his game and lost his stake.
That is plain to every one. But <em>you</em> have the cards still in
your hand. Do not spoil your chance.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean my chance of success? I thought you despised
success.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
“I mean your chance of a noble life. But I ought not to
have said ‘chance.’ There is none.”</p>

<p>“There is destiny.”</p>

<p>“There is <em>will</em>. Your will, and God’s will, which means only
good to you, if you will accept it.”</p>

<p>“There is something in what you say,&mdash;especially about
secret meetings,” he added in a lower tone. “But it is late; I
must go to those mathematics. Good night.” He turned away,
softly whistling the air of a song very popular with the Imperialists,
<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">“Veillons au salut de l’Empire</span>.” “<em>I</em> shall watch henceforward
over the safety of something else, very dear to Prince
Pojarsky,” thought the conceited but generous boy. “How
little he guesses what plans we have talked of&mdash;we Buonapartists&mdash;at
those secret meetings he denounces! Such, for instance,
as the assassination of a certain great personage, in <em>his</em> innocent
eyes the greatest in the world! But if ever again, in my presence,
any one dares to drop a hint on that subject, I swear the
words shall be his last!”</p>

<span class="smcap1 i">Ivan</span> could afford just now to be very generous and
very patient, because he was very happy. There
was sunshine not only on his path but in his heart.
Almost at the same time that the best of earthly
blessings had been given him, he was given also the conscious
possession of the love divine; and he received it in thankful,
trustful joy. Christ had come to him, not in sorrow, as he
comes to many, but making the brightest hours of life infinitely
brighter by his presence.</p>

<p>He thought he had nothing to do but to tell Clémence the
new happiness he had found, and that she would immediately
understand and share it; that she would no longer be content
to wait for acceptance with God until some future day, but
would henceforth enjoy the glad consciousness of being already
accepted in the Beloved. But to her tender conscience and
thoughtful mind difficulties presented themselves which had
never troubled the eager, impulsive Ivan. Her fears of self-deception,
of presumption, of spiritual pride, raised up a host
of shadowy disturbers of the peace within, which Ivan had not
skill enough to combat. He urged her therefore to come with
him and hear the teachers from whom he had learned so much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
Madame de Krudener had come to Paris, and established herself
in a house adjoining the Elysée Bourbon, where she held
what would now be called “drawing-room meetings,” to which
all the rank and fashion of Paris were flocking. It was strange
that for once religious meetings became the rage in the very
stronghold of ungodliness, vice, and frivolity. Many of the
visitors had their curiosity piqued by the extraordinary reports
that reached them, and wished to ascertain the truth for themselves;
many more “went to scoff,” and of these a goodly
number “remained to pray.”<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> But the greatest attraction to
these <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soirées</i> was the hope of seeing the Emperor of Russia&mdash;a
hope, however, not often gratified. Far from parading his
religion, Alexander was strongly tempted to conceal it. His
sensitive nature dreaded ridicule; and he was well aware that
a profession of personal religion would expose him to the most
polished shafts of that exquisite Parisian wit, which, keen as
the scimitar of Saladin, could divide asunder, with fine, unerring
touch, the most delicate fibres of thought and feeling. Even in
Protestant London&mdash;which he always placed in honourable contrast
to Paris for seriousness and morality&mdash;he had observed
that religious laymen were looked upon almost with contempt.
It was therefore not without much prayer and conflict that he
took his stand on the side of God in the face of all the world.</p>

<p>He did not often mingle with the throng that filled the
drawing-rooms of Madame de Krudener to overflowing on three
or four evenings of every week; but he frequently came later,
when his day’s work was over, for prayer and quiet study of the
Scriptures. These hours of communion were prolonged until
far into the night; yet he always rose at five in the morning, so
that no man was able to reproach him with any lack of diligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
in business, nor was any part of the heavy burden of care and
responsibility that fell to his lot neglected or avoided.</p>

<p>Clémence would gladly have accompanied Ivan to some of
Madame de Krudener’s meetings; and Madame de Talmont,
though she had her objections, might have gone also, but for the
determined opposition of Madame de Salgues. “In my time,”
said the lady of the old régime, “women did not preach; and
certainly, if they had done so, ‘gens comme il faut’ would not
have gone to hear them. Why should you need Madame de
Krudener to tell you to repent and believe? I suppose you
hear those Christian duties inculcated every Sunday and holiday
when you go to church.”</p>

<p>“Many people go to hear Madame de Krudener who never
enter a church,” Clémence observed.</p>

<p>“That is possible,” returned Madame de Salgues. “Sick
people, who will not eat wholesome food, sometimes take a fancy
for extraordinary messes, and a wise doctor gives them their
way. But you, my dear niece, are certainly not in that position.”</p>

<p>“Madame de Krudener does not always speak; sometimes
it is M. Empaytaz, a Swiss pastor, who gives the address,”
Clémence ventured again.</p>

<p>“Worse and worse, my dear! A <em>Protestant</em>!” cried Madame
de Salgues in a tone of horror. “I sometimes wonder what the
world is coming to. All barriers, all distinctions seem to be
swept away in these revolutionary days.”</p>

<p>Henri was sitting in another part of the room, occupied with
a book; and none, save Clémence, noticed the flush of pain that
overspread his face at these words.</p>

<p>Ivan and Clémence agreed that it would not be right for the
latter to set aside the expressed wish of a relative to whom she
owed so much. Therefore, instead of listening to Madame de
Krudener or Empaytaz, she studied the Bible diligently, both
alone and with Ivan, and lost nothing by going to the fountainhead,
instead of to streams, not always of undeniable purity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
Yet her desire to see and hear the remarkable woman whose
words were making so great an impression was very natural,
and was destined at length to be gratified. One morning, while
the family were seated at their eleven o’clock <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">déjeûner</i>, they
were honoured by a visit from Stéphanie de Sartines. The
little girl was intensely conscious of a new silk dress&mdash;green
shot with pink, which shone and glistened with each of her
quick, restless movements&mdash;and of a large Tuscan hat adorned
with a wreath of blush roses. She exchanged greetings, in a
highly satisfied tone, with every one in the room, and then,
coming to the side of Clémence, began as usual, “Papa says he
will allow me&mdash;”</p>

<p>The smile that passed round the group was not unnoticed by
the observant Stéphanie. She looked up quickly, but resumed
her little speech after a moment’s hesitation. “Papa says he
will allow me to go and hear Madame de Krudener preaching
to the children, if you will be kind enough to accompany me,
mademoiselle,&mdash;I mean Madame la Princesse; and if M. le
Prince will permit you,” she continued, bowing towards Ivan
with the air of a little queen.</p>

<p>“If no one objects more than I do, Madame la Princesse is
quite at your service, mademoiselle,” answered Ivan, with a
smile and a bow as ceremonious as her own.&mdash;“I am on duty
to-day, as you are aware, m’amie,” he added in a lower voice to
Clémence.</p>

<p>“I thought the old lady kept her ghostly admonitions for
those who needed them&mdash;hardened transgressors like M. de
Talleyrand, for example,” said Emile. “Does she lecture children
too, for variety?”</p>

<p>“It appears she does. <em>You</em> ought to go and hear her, M.
Emile,” returned Stéphanie gravely. “It would do you good.&mdash;But
really, madame,” she added, addressing Clémence again,
“you <em>must</em> come. It will be so&mdash;so delightful, so exciting, so
<em>amusing</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
“My dear child, one does not go to a religious service to be
amused,” observed Madame de Talmont.</p>

<p>“Ah, madame, you cannot imagine how delicious it is! My
cousin Coralie has told me all about it. Madame de Krudener
visited Coralie’s pension and preached to the young ladies, and
you never saw anything like it! They were all moved&mdash;they
shed torrents of tears&mdash;it must have been grand, beautiful; a
great deal better than going to the theatre&mdash;even when Talma
is acting, as papa would say. I would give the whole world to
see it for myself, and to know what it is all about. Come&mdash;<em>do
come</em>, mademoiselle&mdash;madame, I mean.&mdash;Prince Ivan, I beg of
you to send her with me.”</p>

<p>“You are most welcome to her escort as far as I am concerned,”
Ivan answered. “But, mademoiselle, if you or I were
going to meet even an earthly monarch, I think we should do
so with a little more seriousness.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that reminds me&mdash;that is the best thing of all. Coralie
says that the Czar is coming to the meeting to see the children.&mdash;What
do you think of <em>that</em>, M. Emile?”</p>

<p>“I think he may go wherever he pleases; he is sure to be
welcome,” returned Emile with unusual graciousness.</p>

<p>Ivan gave him a quick glance of surprise and pleasure, then
said, turning to Stéphanie, “May I ask where you heard that,
mademoiselle? For it does not look very probable.”</p>

<p>“Oh, M. de Berckheim told Coralie’s father; for he is a great
friend of his. This is not a little meeting in a school-room,
Prince Ivan; it will be quite a grand affair. Any children who
like may come, and grown-up people too. There will be crowds,
no doubt. I daresay we shall find it hard to get seats. It will
be altogether delightful. Besides, I am longing to see the Czar.”</p>

<p>A few questions about time and place were asked, and the
answers showed that Stéphanie had carefully considered every
detail of her plan. “We can get a fiacre,” she said, “and be
there in three-quarters of an hour.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
Madame de Salgues, who had been silent hitherto, now spoke
in a gracious tone. “If you are to hear this woman at all,
Clémence, it appears to me that you could not do so in a manner
less open to objection. Go, my dear niece, if you wish it.”</p>

<p>“I am at your service, Stéphanie,” Clémence said smiling;
and she rose to leave the room. As she passed the chair of her
aunt she kissed her hand with a grateful look; and the old lady
responded kindly, “I hope you will enjoy yourself, my dear.”
She had been greatly touched, though she had said nothing, by
the quietness with which Clémence had given up what was
evidently her own and her husband’s wish, in deference to her
feelings.</p>

<p>“I must own, mon ami,” Clémence said to Ivan, who joined
her while she was making her simple toilet, “I think it is a
pity the Czar should go to a meeting such as Stéphanie expects
this to be.”</p>

<p>“Why so, if it please you, my princess?” asked Ivan, rather
surprised.</p>

<p>“Because,” she answered, “the children will all be gazing at
the great people instead of listening to what Madame de
Krudener is saying to them. Besides, it is bad for them&mdash;is it
not?&mdash;to think themselves objects of attention. The less the
religion of children is noticed and talked about the better.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you need not fear. The presence of half-a-dozen gentlemen,
in a large public room, will be scarcely observed by the
children; and who is to tell them that one of them is the Czar?
You don’t know, Clémence,” he added with a change of tone,
“how his heart yearns over the little ones. In England, no
sight pleased him so well as the annual gathering of the charity
children under the dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral. And I have
seen him myself in Dresden, when he lodged in the Bruhl
Palace, come out in the evening to watch the children playing
in the gardens, which he would not allow to be closed against
them. Three little princesses&mdash;‘daughters of Russia’&mdash;are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
sleeping in the Church of St. Alexander Nevsky at St. Petersburg,
and God never gave him a son.”</p>

<p>But Stéphanie’s impatient voice was heard in the passage, so,
after a tender little farewell to Clémence, Ivan escorted the
ladies to a fiacre, and saw them depart.</p>

<p>The room where the meeting was held was crowded when
they arrived. However, Coralie saw her cousin and Clémence
seeking a place, and persuaded the governess who had charge of
her party to make room for them. Clémence at first regretted
this, for the girls began to chatter amongst themselves about
their dress and other trifles in a way well calculated to put to
flight all serious impressions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile she looked with much interest on the face and
figure of the person about whom Ivan had told her so much.
Perhaps on the whole she was disappointed: the worn and
haggard features had in her eyes no charm save one, the charm
of intense earnestness and utter sincerity. The thought passed
through her mind, “That is a woman from whom I might learn
much as a teacher, but I could never trust her as a guide.” One
thing, however, she learned that day&mdash;that the Pietists neither
thought lightly of sin themselves, nor induced others to think
lightly of it. The “Gray Sister of Hearts” (so Clémence remembered
Ivan’s calling Madame de Krudener) denounced in scathing
accents just those sins of which the world thinks least&mdash;the
sins of childhood. Conceit, selfishness, disobedience, forgetfulness
of God, were exposed in terms that Clémence might have
thought exaggerated, had she not remembered that the poison-seed
is the poison-plant in embryo. Never before had she felt so
<span class="locked">thoroughly&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“That the most childish sin a child can do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is yet a sin which Jesus never did<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Jesus was a child, and yet a sin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For which he came in lowly pain to die.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>By-and-by the speaker’s tone changed, and with a tenderness
of look and manner of which Clémence felt all the charm, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
spoke of “the child-loved Lover of children,” of the Shepherd
who gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them in his
bosom, who gave his life for the sheep and the lambs so willingly,
so patiently, so lovingly. “My little child,” she seemed to say
to every one present, “he died for <em>thee</em>, he loves <em>thee</em>, he
speaks to <em>thee</em> and says, ‘My son, or my daughter, give me
thine heart, and give it to-day.’”</p>

<p>While she listened, the head of Stéphanie had sunk very low,
her face was quite shaded by the broad leaf of her hat, and
Clémence saw with wonder that tears were falling quick and
fast upon the cherished silk, utterly unheeded by its owner.
She tried gently to take her hand; but Stéphanie, with a quick,
impetuous movement, drew it away.</p>

<p>When the meeting was at an end, any who wished for private
conversation were invited to remain.</p>

<p>“Shall we go home, dear?” Clémence whispered. Stéphanie
shook her head with a vehement negative. Her slight frame
was quivering with convulsive sobs. After an interval Clémence
asked gently, “Why are you weeping so bitterly? Tell me,
dear. Is it for your sin?”</p>

<p>The child looked up quickly. “Not all&mdash;not <em>most</em>&mdash;for that.
Most because I have grieved Him, and He is so good.”</p>

<p>Clémence said no more; she prayed in silence for her little
friend. Her own deep inward life had taught her great
reverence for the soul of another. Even in that of a child there
might be mysteries with which no hand but God’s could deal
aright. Stéphanie prayed too, for the first time in her life.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the “Gray Sister of Hearts” was going quietly
amongst the children who, like Stéphanie, had remained,
advising, comforting, and instructing them, according to the
power God had given her. At last she came to Stéphanie.
“My little girl, why do you weep?” she asked, with that
peculiar tenderness which in great measure accounted for the
spiritual magnetism she exercised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
“I am holding out my hand to the Lord Jesus, and he will
not take it,” was the answer.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<p>“That is only because his arms are around you already, dear
little one,” she said. She added many loving words, to which
Clémence as well as Stéphanie listened with deep interest.
At length she kissed a farewell to her little pupil, in whose
eyes a happy light had begun to shine. “I am ready to go
now,” said Stéphanie, putting her hand in that of Clémence.</p>

<p>It was late when they reached home. Madame de Salgues
and Madame de Talmont were beginning to grow uneasy, and
Henri had just volunteered to go in search of the wanderers.
They were warmly welcomed; and, as had been already
arranged, Stéphanie remained to spend the rest of the day
with her friends.</p>

<p>While Madame de Talmont asked Clémence many questions
about the meeting, Emile opened a fire of banter upon Stéphanie,
about the effect her dress and appearance had produced upon
the assembly, and especially upon the Czar, “The very least
I expected of his Imperial Majesty,” he said, “was to send an
aide-de-camp to inquire who was the charming young lady in
pink and green silk.”</p>

<p>But Stéphanie did not reply with her usual saucy readiness;
and Henri, noticing her agitation, quickly came to her relief,
making some commonplace inquiry about the numbers who were
present.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see what is the matter,” said Emile: “the Czar was
not there after all. Very unlike him, to disappoint so many
young ladies.”</p>

<p>Stéphanie gave the surprising answer, “I do not know if he
was there. I never thought of him at all.”</p>

<p>Then Clémence drew her gently away to her own room, leaving
her there in quiet until supper was ready. As she went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
out Madame de Salgues observed, “I really think that child is
improving&mdash;at least in appearance. This evening she looks
almost pretty.”</p>

<p>“I have always said that Mademoiselle Stéphanie de
Sartines will one day be a beautiful woman,” Henri answered
in a tone of decision.</p>

<span class="smcap1 y"><span class="epubonly">“</span>You</span> must all come, my friends,” said Ivan. “I
have set my heart upon it.” He had been
describing the preparations for the grand review
of the Russian army which was to take place a
few days later in the “Plaine des Vertus.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; you must all go, certainly,” remarked Madame de
Salgues.</p>

<p>“Unless Madame de Salgues is obliging enough to be of the
party, no one will go,” said Ivan. “I know that at least I can
speak for Clémence.”</p>

<p>“But what to do, my friend? It will take three days at the
very least&mdash;one to go, one to stay, and one to return. And
then, think of the crowds! Who knows even whether we shall
find room in any of the hotels?”</p>

<p>“You need have no anxiety about that, madame. The
Emperor has engaged all the hotels and posting establishments
of the district. I have only to obtain his order,
through his secretary, for everything you require, and I know
that I can do so. You must stay for the religious service on
the day following the review; it will be the Emperor’s name-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
“I should certainly like to witness <em>that</em>,” said Madame de
Talmont.</p>

<p>“I am sorry that my duties must deprive me of the pleasure
of being your attendant cavalier,” pursued Ivan. “But Henri
and Emile will more than supply my place; and you may
perhaps wish to invite a friend to join your party.”</p>

<p>“If we engage a carriage,” said Madame de Talmont, “we
can accommodate another lady. Who shall it be, ma tante?”</p>

<p>“It is for Prince Ivan to express his wishes on that point.”</p>

<p>Ivan gracefully referred the choice to the ladies, and Clémence
pleaded for Stéphanie. “She has been so good lately, poor
child,” she said. “And this will be a pleasure she will
remember all her life.”</p>

<p>“By all means. Let us have her father too,” suggested
Emile. “For I hear that this wonderful Madame de Krudener
is to be there; and as she is the only person who has ever
succeeded in taming mademoiselle, perhaps a little arrangement
with M. de Sartines&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold thy peace, Emile,” said Madame de Salgues. “I will
have no jests levelled in my presence at religious persons, be
they whom they may; and I suppose this enigmatical old lady
is some kind of irregular nun, or at least a Carmelite. I cannot
pretend to say what she is:&mdash;but, my dear grandson, you must
permit me to observe that your tone of late has been very
offensive to me. It is entirely that of the Empire, not that in
which you have been educated. Your manners, too, have quite
deteriorated. They are becoming absolutely bourgeoise.”</p>

<p>“Pardon, madame,” returned Emile with a bow. “I am
sorry they do not please you. But you must acknowledge they
are not likely to be mended by the life I am leading,” he added
a little bitterly. “Idleness is the mother of mischief.”</p>

<p>Madame de Salgues relinquished the useless altercation with
a sigh; and Ivan for the second time sought a private interview
with Emile, following him into the little room where he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
wont to indulge his habit of smoking at a safe distance from
his grandmother.</p>

<p>Ivan showed him a piece of paper. “I shall not insult you
by asking whether you know anything about this,” he said.</p>

<p>It was the copy of a letter addressed to the Czar by a person
who signed himself “Captain of Regicides,” threatening him
with instant death if he would not immediately proclaim
Napoleon II.</p>

<p>“I should like to hear you do it!” cried Emile indignantly,
as he flung the paper on the ground, and set his heel upon it.
“I should like better still to find out the author of that precious
document, and to treat him <em>so</em>,” he added, grinding it beneath
his foot. “Such scoundrels bring the good cause into disrepute.
But the Emperor Alexander has too much courage and good
sense to regard them.”</p>

<p>“True; yet others may be forced to regard them for him.
The threat has not been an empty one, Emile. They have
tried to poison him.”</p>

<p>“<em>Never!</em>” cried Emile, starting and changing colour.</p>

<p>“And nearly succeeded,” Ivan continued sadly. “All our
joy in the present, all our happy plans for the future, might
to-day have been turned into mourning. And not ours
only&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But how was it?” Emile interrupted.</p>

<p>“It occurred to his cook, contrary to his usual practice, to
taste the wine laid ready for his master’s use at dinner. The
poor fellow’s life has been saved with the utmost difficulty.”</p>

<p>“That is abominable!” cried Emile. “If I but knew the miscreant
who did it, I would spare the executioner a bad business.
Peste! if we want a victim, we Imperialists&mdash;and perhaps it is
not unnatural we should&mdash;we ought to take Gneisenau who
proposed a scaffold for the Emperor, Talleyrand who deceived
and betrayed everybody impartially all round, or old Louis
himself who ran away from his throne without striking a blow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
We might spare at least the one chivalrous enemy who always
spared us.”</p>

<p>“It would be better for yourselves,” said Ivan. “And for
others too. Baron Muffling<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> says he is longing to get the Czar
out of Paris, as, if he is assassinated, or even insulted, no power
on earth would be able to avert a general massacre of the
inhabitants by the Allies.”</p>

<p>“Which <em>you</em> would take part in, Prince Ivan.”</p>

<p>Ivan was silent for a moment, then he said in a tone of deep
feeling, “Do not ask me. I am a Christian, I hope, but I am
a <em>man</em> also. I know not what I would do. God grant I may
not be put to the test.”</p>

<p>There was a pause, then Emile asked, “What does <em>he</em>
say?”</p>

<p>“If I tell you, will you scoff?”</p>

<p>“At him? No; that I can promise you.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, he has asked his friends to pray for him.”</p>

<p>“Useless, but harmless,” said Emile with an air of generous
toleration. “Very clever persons have worn amulets; and
even the great Napoleon was not free from a superstition or
two.”</p>

<p>“Not as an amulet against steel or poison does my Czar think
of prayer. ‘Do not pray,’ he says, ‘that I may be guarded
from the evil that man can do to me; I have no fears on these
grounds. I know that I am in the hands of God.’”</p>

<p>“That is like Napoleon’s confidence in his star,” thought
Emile. He had almost uttered his thought aloud, but he
checked himself in time. For he reflected that this was not
blind confidence in a thing, in some unknown power&mdash;chance,
fate, or destiny&mdash;but rather, what Ivan had spoken of to him
before, trust in a <em>Person</em>.</p>

<p>Ivan resumed presently, “What he desires his friends to ask
for him is protection from the evil influences of the world, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
specially <em>from those of this city</em>. Emile, you understand something
of his meaning, and of mine?”</p>

<p>Emile turned aside to avoid meeting the eyes of Ivan, for his
words had touched a chord within. Thrown in idleness upon
the great, unquiet, corrupt world of Paris, the position of the
youth was truly perilous. Secret political intrigue was wooing
him upon the one hand, while vice was spreading its snares to
allure him upon the other. Ivan had succeeded in conveying
an emphatic warning at the same time against both.</p>

<p>“I wish I were more like Henri,” Emile said at last. “He
is sometimes tiresome&mdash;a little, but he is as steady as a rock, a
perfect gentleman, and a stainless man of honour.”</p>

<p>“God will help you, Emile; then all will be well,” said Ivan
as he left the room.</p>

<p>The manifold excitements of the next few days put aside for
the time all graver thoughts. The unpretending carriage of
the De Talmonts mingled with a continuous stream of other
vehicles on their way to the Plaine des Vertus, and the striking
and amusing sights afforded by the journey were almost sufficient
to turn the brain, of Stéphanie at least. But the grand review
itself confused and bewildered the imaginations of far more
experienced spectators. “Do not ask me what I think of it,”
said Madame de Salgues in the evening, when at last a happy,
weary, excited party sat down to rest in their hotel. “I feel
as if for a whole year at least I had not been myself, but some
one else, and had been living amidst glare and glitter, bright
colours and splendid uniforms. Such masses of men moving as
one&mdash;such glorious martial music!&mdash;such deafening thunder of
artillery!&mdash;I could not have dreamed of anything like it.”</p>

<p>Emile whistled softly to himself. “It has made my grandmother
quite poetical,” he said.</p>

<p>“That is not wonderful,” remarked Madame de Talmont.
“It was indeed the poetry of war.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Henri thoughtfully; “and if <em>I</em> had not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
forced to read the stern and rugged prose, I should have looked
at it with other eyes. But all the time I could not help thinking
how many gallant men like those I had seen die in misery.”</p>

<p>“But did you know what they were doing at the end?”
asked Emile. “That last tremendous charge, that made all the
ladies start and change colour, was what is called a charge in
line. It was right well done too, though it has long been
thought no one could manage it except the English. With such
material, and under such leadership, nothing is impossible.
With an army like that,” he added a little sadly, “Napoleon
would conquer the world.”</p>

<p>Just then Ivan came in to pay his friends a short visit, and
to see that they were comfortably accommodated. Many were
the compliments addressed to him and the questions asked of
him, especially by Emile. “The discipline of your army seems
admirable,” said he. “I should like to know how it is
managed.”</p>

<p>“Like all other discipline worth the name,” Ivan answered;
“by justice and mercy. The Czar knows how to punish,
though he loves to pardon.”</p>

<p>“Of course he must punish sometimes; but one does not hear
of it.”</p>

<p>“He knows how to punish in ways you could not hear of.
A word, a look, silence even, he can make a terrible punishment.
But this power he rarely uses. I have heard it said
that he ‘can annihilate a man without touching him;’ but I
have never seen him do it, and I hope I never shall.”</p>

<p>“Nor I either,” said Emile.</p>

<p>“I know of <em>one</em> reproof he administered. One of our colonels
failed to have his regiment ready at the time appointed for
reviewing it. He received a severe reprimand, and was broken-hearted.
The Czar saw it, sought him out afterwards, and
comforted him, telling him that ‘it was not for one mistake the
faithful services of years could be forgotten.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
“If,” said Madame de Talmont, “there was any drawback to
our enjoyment to-day, it was the difficulty we found in recognizing
the great personages we wished to see amidst all the
brilliant confusion. We needed our Chevalier of Malta by our
side to point them out to us.”</p>

<p>“He would willingly have been there, madame,” said Ivan
bowing. “But to-morrow you will find it easier to distinguish
them. At the grand religious ceremony all will be present.
You will see the royal personages assembled in the tent where
they are to hear the service.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Stéphanie, “that will be delightful! I am longing
to see the great English Duke Vellington, who conquered
General Buonaparte,&mdash;or the ex-Emperor, as one may say,” she
added considerately, with a sly glance at Emile.</p>

<p>Their expectations were not disappointed. The solemn
pageant of the following day was graced by a glittering galaxy
of royal stars, upon which no eye could rest without emotion.
Beside Alexander stood the wayward, ungainly Constantine,
unlike him in all but brotherly love; and next to him, the
young Grand Dukes, Nicholas and Michael. The King of
Prussia was there, with his two sons,&mdash;one of them destined to
wear hereafter an imperial diadem; the Emperor of Austria,
with some members of his family; and, most admired of all
perhaps, little Stéphanie’s hero, the Iron Duke.</p>

<p>But the sense of these great earthly presences passed away
and was forgotten in the solemn awe of the scene that
followed. “An immense army of conquerors” all at the same
instant fell on their knees in prayer and thanksgiving. Each
regiment, led by its own chaplain, moved in harmony with the
rest. Magnificent vestments, fragrant incense, and the most
exquisite vocal music contributed their charms; until, to those
who witnessed it, it seemed as if this worship scarcely belonged
to earth. After the breathless, spell-bound silence that followed
the last chanted psalm of praise, Clémence faltered tearfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
“I think it is like that perfect worship in the courts above,
where the great multitude, whom no man can number, fall on
their faces before the Throne.”</p>

<p>“Ah, sister mine!” said Henri with a sigh, “there is no perfect
worship here. And this,&mdash;beautiful as it is, is far indeed
from perfect. I doubt even whether it is quite in accordance
with what we know of the will of God. But,” he added softly,
“‘the good Lord pardon every one that prepareth his heart to
seek the Lord God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed
according to the purification of the sanctuary.’”</p>

<p>The religious service over, the guests strolled through the
camp, enjoying the sweet summer weather, and the curious and
interesting sights that met their view on every side. Amongst
the crowd of visitors there was no happier party than that of
Madame de Talmont. Joy had ripened the quiet grace of
Clémence into a sweet and rare loveliness; there was a soft
and steady light in her dark eyes, and the glow of perfect
health upon her cheek. She was dressed that day with unusual
care; Ivan himself had superintended her toilet for the expedition,
and had chosen the simple exquisitely-fitting robe of silver
gray silk which she wore. And that morning, before the service,
he brought her the loveliest of roses, crimson and cream
colour, and fastened them in her belt, “for the Emperor’s fête,”
he said.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon his friends met him; he was
walking with a group of officers of distinguished appearance.
Coming to the side of Clémence, he took her hand and led her
gently forward. “His Imperial Majesty wishes to be presented
to you,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>If Clémence felt a momentary embarrassment, it was quickly
dispelled; for a very courteous gentleman was bowing over her
hand, and a kind voice was saying pleasant things of “my
friend Prince Pojarsky,” and of the welcome which awaited
Madame la Princesse for his sake in St. Petersburg. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
she answered, or what other introductions followed she scarcely
knew, for all that passed seemed like a dream, only far more
easy and natural. “<em>That</em> the Emperor!” said Stéphanie afterwards.
“I should not have been at all afraid to talk to him
myself. He was only a gentleman.”<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>“<em>Only</em> a gentleman?” Madame de Talmont repeated. “Such
gentlemen are not so plentiful, my little Stéphanie.”</p>

<p>“But that Prince Ivan is doubtless well acquainted with the
etiquette of his own court, I should say he made a blunder,”
observed Madame de Salgues. “A lady, were she the highest
of the land, would be presented to the King of France, not the
King to the lady.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and the King would go in to dinner before his guest,
were that guest an Emperor,” said Emile. “Certainly no one
can call Louis Dix-huit ‘only a gentleman.’”</p>

<p>“Prince Ivan may be trusted in matters of etiquette,” said
Henri. He added apart to Clémence, “Do you remember,
sister mine, the good things we two agreed to ask for the man
who saved my life?”</p>

<p>“Love, joy, peace, God’s best gifts. And there is that in his
face to-day, Henri, which makes me think God has heard and
answered our prayer.”</p>

<p>They were not mistaken. A few words, spoken that evening
to intimate friends, show how truly Alexander dwelt then in
the secret place of the Most High. “This day has been the
most glorious of my life, I shall never forget it,” he said; but
never surely did king or conqueror give so unique a reason for
his joy and triumph: “My heart has been filled with love for
my enemies. I have been able to pray fervently for them all;
and it is with tears and at the foot of the cross that I have
prayed for the welfare of France.”</p>

<p>Such joy as this is like the name in the white stone, “which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
no man knoweth save he that receiveth it.” It would lose its
beauty and its reality if passed from lip to lip as a common
thing. Nor was it. It was told at the time in confidence to
those who should have held it as a sacred trust; and the confidence
was not violated until, for Alexander, all earthly joys
and sorrows were no more. His <em>joy</em> was his own; but his <em>faith</em>
was a thing to be confessed before all the world. And such a
confession was the real meaning and purport of the celebrated
Holy Alliance,&mdash;so greatly discussed, ridiculed, wondered over,
blamed.</p>

<p>To Alexander, and to Alexander alone, belongs unquestionably
the responsibility of this act, in which, not without
much difficulty, he obtained the concurrence of his brother
sovereigns. There is no doubt that it was his hand
which penned the remarkable document itself, as well as
the private letter which accompanied it when sent for
signature to the English Prince Regent. A few words from
this letter may explain his intention. “The events,” says
Alexander, “which have afflicted the world for more than
twenty years have convinced us that the only means of putting
an end to them is to be found in the closest union between the
sovereigns whom Divine Providence has placed at the head of
the nations of Europe. The history of the three last memorable
years is a proof of the happy effect this union has produced
for the safety of mankind. But to assure to this bond the
solidity required by the greatness and purity of the end to
which it tends, it ought to be founded on the sacred principles
of the Christian religion. Deeply penetrated by this important
truth, we have signed the act we submit to-day to the meditation
of your Royal Highness. You will see its object is to
strengthen the ties uniting us, in forming the people of
Christendom into one family, and in assuring to them, under
the protection of the All-Powerful, the happiness and safety of
peace in the ties of an indissoluble fraternity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
The purpose of the Holy Alliance was threefold. It was
firstly, as has been intimated, a solemn confession of faith in
Christ, which Alexander, both as man and as sovereign, made
for himself, and desired his brother sovereigns to make also.
It was, moreover, a solemn declaration of the brotherhood and
unity of all Christian nations. And, lastly and chiefly, it was a
bond and pledge of peace. A stable, enduring, universal peace
had been the dream of Alexander from the days of his youth.
He had seen much of the miseries of war; and to his noble,
sensitive, romantic spirit, ever full of longings for the happiness
of humanity, the vision of terminating all these miseries, and
ushering in a glad new period of joy, security, and prosperity,
robed itself in the fairest colours. Once and again did he say,
at different epochs, that he would willingly give his own life for
the peace of the world. It was a poet’s dream, to be wrought
out, not in the stately march of rhythmic words, but in the
more enduring language of golden deeds.</p>

<p>Two good things, which seemed to bring nearer the fulfilment
of his dream, happened almost at the same time. His great
antagonist, the troubler of nations, who had hitherto made
peace impossible, was laid low; while to himself Christ came in
conscious, realized presence, saying to his soul, “I am thy salvation.”
Was it strange if he thought the great work Christ
had given him to do was to establish this longed-for peace upon
the foundation of a firm and enduring faith in Him? “Oh,
how happy I am!” said he in one of those moments of
private intercourse with congenial friends in which heart and
lips were opened. “My Saviour is with me. I am a great
sinner, but he will make me his instrument in obtaining peace
for the people. Oh, if all people would understand the ways of
Providence, if they would but obey the gospel, how happy they
would be!”</p>

<p>That splendid, impossible “if” was the rock upon which the
whole project&mdash;like a gallant bark richly freighted&mdash;foundered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
and was wrecked. As it has been well said, “In desiring to
Christianize the world, Alexander attempted the impossible.
He vainly flattered himself that he could regulate according to
the gospel the transactions of nations and individuals who had
never submitted to the gospel; but it was the error of a noble
heart, and so much the more excusable because, uniting in himself
the civil and religious supremacy within his own empire, he
had no means of ascertaining how far the reign of Christ is not
of this world. Because he misconceived this truth, he sowed
his path with inextricable difficulties, he saw his noble desires
abandoned to ridicule.”<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<p>If the leading statesmen of Europe, to each of whom in turn
the Holy Alliance had to be submitted, did not venture to
ridicule it openly, it was not so much because the document
came from an imperial hand, as because they thought it involved
them in difficulties of too grave a character. It was natural
that Metternich and Talleyrand should hesitate to advise their
sovereigns to sign such a paper; regarding it, as they did, as a
mere rodomontade, with no more bearing upon practical business
than a tale out of the Arabian Nights. Castlereagh’s letter to
Lord Liverpool presents a vivid picture of these perplexities.
He foresees that, “as Wilberforce is not yet in possession of
the Great Seal,” there may be some difficulty in passing the
document through the ordinary course of office; but he considerately
hopes that no person will blame the Prince Regent
for not refusing to sign it, “when the objection lies rather
against the <em>excessive excellence</em> than the quality and nature of
the engagement.”</p>

<p>Doubtless from their point of view the statesmen were right.
The Holy Alliance was an anachronism. The world was not
ready for it. It was like a spring flower which, opening ere
the frosts of winter have departed, is doomed to wither in their
chill ungenial breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
But the flower, though it perishes untimely, has not lived in
vain. It has told its tale and borne its message. It is not only
one of Nature’s unfulfilled promises, it is also one of her unconscious
prophecies. In every age and season there are hints and
premonitions and vague foreshadowings of that which is to
follow, promises “which are written upon the heart of things.”
Winter has her prophecies of spring, and spring of summer. It
is the very nature of these to be abortive, or at least to bear no
fruit unto perfection. In one sense they are failures, but in another
they are nobler and more precious than all present successes.</p>

<span class="smcap1 y"><span class="epubonly">“</span>Yes</span>, the first snow of winter is falling. Does my
Clémence regret exchanging the flowers of France
for the snows of Russia?”</p>

<p>“<em>Do I?</em>” she asked, looking confidingly into
Ivan’s face while she leaned on his arm. They were standing
at a window in the old castle of Nicolofsky, watching the white
flakes as they fell gently to the ground. It was night, but a
full moon shed its soft, pure radiance, over the peaceful scene.
“Our first night at home, Ivan,” she continued. “I shall love
this place. I am so glad we came here at once.”</p>

<p>“And I am so glad to hear you say so. I have often felt,
Clémence, that it was too generous, too unselfish of you and

offer of a post in the Army of Occupation, which would have
kept us together in France, perhaps for years.”</p>

<p>“You know, Ivan, that you are needed here.”</p>

<p>“I know it. I must get rid of Dmitri at once; and my only
way of doing so is by being my own steward. I fear he has
used my poor friends here very hardly. Yet, according to his
light, he has been faithful; and after Zoubof’s letter, pleading his
cause so earnestly, I could not well set him aside for another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
It is true I neither respect Zoubof nor like him,&mdash;though he has
behaved very courteously to me, being evidently well satisfied
with whatever arrangements the Emperor made with him about
the estate.”</p>

<p>“If you are your own steward, Ivan, will you not have to
remain here all the year?”</p>

<p>“Not <em>quite</em>, m’amie,” Ivan answered smiling. “That would
be too great a sacrifice. For this winter, indeed, I purpose
keeping my princess a captive in fetters of frost and snow; and
perhaps next summer we may content ourselves with a visit to
Moscow, our martyr city, of which it is indeed true that we
think upon her stones. But, if God will, the following winter
must be spent in St. Petersburg.”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> should be well content to stay here and work amongst
these poor, faithful-hearted people, who gave us such a loving
welcome to-day. Some of them wept with joy to see you again,
Ivan.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Clémence, I love them dearly; and they love me with
the love they gave poor little Ivan Barrinka long ago. Still&mdash;the
capital has attractions&mdash;”</p>

<p>Clémence smiled. “It was a sacrifice for you to abandon the
army,” she said.</p>

<p>“How could I do otherwise? God gave me these people.
Besides,” Ivan added, “my great temptation to remain in the
service was the hope of one day becoming an imperial aide-de-camp.
But for these posts there are far too many candidates
already. It will now be necessary for the Czar to place his
army upon a peace-footing, and a very difficult task that will
be.&mdash;But, m’amie, you have not told me yet what you think of
this old, tumble-down owl’s nest of a castle?”</p>

<p>“The château is much better than I expected, Ivan. A few
judicious repairs will do a great deal; and we can adorn and
beautify as much as we like. I mean to have the loveliest of
gardens, in spite of the climate; and to induce the good folk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
here, if possible, to care for and cultivate a few flowers for
themselves.”</p>

<p>Ivan shook his head. “And share the common fate of
reformers,” he said. “The mujik is a good fellow, but you will
find it hard to move him. He hates change, even change for
the better. If he ever learn to read his Bible, as I hope with
God’s blessing he will, I think his favourite text will be,
‘Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths.’”</p>

<p>“And yet,” said Clémence, “you tell me he is wonderfully
pliable and imitative; that if you take the little mujik from his
village you can make of him anything you please&mdash;soldier, valet,
coachman, musician, even scholar or artist.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and you can make anything you please of a bar of
iron&mdash;under certain conditions. But it would be almost as easy
to bend the cold iron with your hand as to change the ways of
the bearded mujik under the roof of his own izba.&mdash;But I think,
dearest, we must rejoin our friends; I hear preparations for
supper in the next room.”</p>

<p>Ivan had brought with him to Nicolofsky an alert, clever
young German doctor, and a gray-haired French priest. It had
been his wish, no less than that of Clémence herself, that his
wife should enjoy the rites of her own communion; and Henri,
who spent much of his leisure in visiting the poor, discovered
amongst them an old acquaintance of the family, who seemed
exactly suited for the post of domestic chaplain to Madame la
Princesse Pojarsky. M. Grandpierre, a relative of the valued
and faithful steward of the De Talmonts, was the curé of a
country parish in La Vendée when the war broke out. He
stoutly exhorted his parishioners to fight for their King; marched
with them to the field; ministered to the wounded and shrived
the dying, often amidst the rain of Republican bullets. When
the cause he loved was lost, he took refuge in Paris; and there,
after years of poverty, Henri found him in a garret of the
Faubourg St. Antoine. Many sorrows had tamed his fiery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
spirit; he was now a humble, simple-minded old man, much
more likely to be the pupil of Clémence than her teacher. Dr.
Krausekopf, a rising young physician from Heidelberg, had
been added to the establishment of Prince Pojarsky, because
Russian doctors were few and unskilful; and Ivan knew it
would be quite useless to introduce a Frenchman in that
capacity, at least if he wished the mujiks of Nicolofsky to
profit by his skill. With the exception of the priest and the
doctor, the household contained only two foreigners, the waiting-woman
of Clémence, who was a widow, and her child, a little
girl.</p>

<p>The next morning, a deputation from the village came to the
castle to welcome their lord. Ivan went to meet them in the
great hall; but he turned back again, saying to Clémence as he
took her hand, “Come, dearest; I want to show my wife to the
man who sheltered my helpless childhood at his own peril. The
good old starost is there, Clémence; and Pope Nikita, the
father of Anna Popovna.”</p>

<p>If anything could have made the mujiks of Nicolofsky doubt
the infallibility of their “Barrinka”&mdash;their loved prince and
master&mdash;it would have been his marriage with a Frenchwoman,
a child of the accursed race who had outraged the soil of holy
Russia. But when the graceful, gracious lady, with her sweet
face, came amongst them, and accepted their homage with such
cordial and winning kindness, their prejudices gave way; and
they vanished entirely when she took in hers the great hard
hand of the aged starost, saying in broken Russian, “Let me
thank you, bativshka, for all the love you showed little Ivan
Barrinka. I must go soon and see your wife, who was his
nurse.” For the priest too she had a word of kindness; and to
each of the rough, bearded mujiks she gave her hand, which
they were fain to kneel and kiss. The starost gazed at her
with tearful eyes, and said something apart to Ivan. “He tells
me,” Ivan explained, “that he thinks you so like my mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
whom I never knew. But he prays that your fate may be
happier than hers.”</p>

<p>The months that followed were spent by Clémence and Ivan
in endeavours to benefit their people. Ivan repaired, as far
as he could, every wrong of which Dmitri had been guilty;
and it was not his fault if any mujik in Nicolofsky lacked
bread, kvass, and kasha in abundance, wool and sheepskins for
clothing, or a well-built and comfortable izba. He tried to
restrict the consumption of vodka, and to promote honesty,
cleanliness, and truthfulness; though, it must be added, with
only partial success. Clémence did her part; and the peasants
soon learned to trust her as their own and their children’s friend.
They loved her still better when she acquired Russian enough
to be an intelligent and sympathetic listener; and in her turn to
tell simple Bible stories, chiefly of our Lord’s life and death, and
most of them to her hearers new and fascinating as a romance.</p>

<p>In the long evenings, Clémence and Ivan, with M. Grandpierre
and Dr. Krausekopf, gave many an hour to earnest,
united study of the Scriptures. The individual character and
experience of each shed a special light upon these readings.
Ivan represented happy, confident, child-like trust; Clémence
devout thoughtfulness, rather tending towards asceticism;
Krausekopf intellectual doubt; and the old priest a dim and
groping faith, which, however, was growing every day more
clear and strong. Each helped the other; and the one great,
ever-present Teacher, who never fails those who seek him, was
helping all.</p>

<p>Letters came to them regularly with tidings of their absent
friends. One day in the early spring Ivan entered the morning
room of Clémence with a radiant face, and in his hand a large
packet. “The post has come. Here, my Clémence,” he said,
as he shared the spoils with her. “Our friends have been
good to us this time;” and he sat down at the window to
enjoy his own portion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
But, as he read, his face changed, and he cast an anxious,
sorrowful glance towards Clémence. Almost at the same
moment a cry broke from her lips, “Oh, Henri&mdash;Henri!”
Ivan went quickly to her side, and laid his hand tenderly on
her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Henri has&mdash;has become a Protestant!” she faltered, in
tones of dismay.</p>

<p>“So he tells me,” said Ivan. “This letter is from him. He
writes like the noble-hearted Christian man that he is. Clémence,
you must not grieve for him. He has done well to
obey the voice of his conscience.”</p>

<p>“But our mother&mdash;it is such a blow for her,” Clémence said
mournfully.</p>

<p>“Yes; I am sorry for her&mdash;<em>very</em>. But, m’amie, God will
help her to bear it, and bring good out of it in the end. <em>I</em> do
not think the change of creed such a weighty matter. What
does anything else signify, so long as a man believes in our
Lord Jesus Christ?” After a pause he resumed, taking up
another letter, “Emile will give us an impartial statement of
the case. Let us see what he says.”</p>

<p>“Emile has behaved well,” Clémence observed, looking over
the remainder of her letter. “My mother says Madame de
Salgues was so angry, that, but for Emile, she and Henri must
have left her house and gone to live in some poor lodging.
But Emile reasoned with her, reminding her that he himself
was once an infidel and a scoffer, which is worse than a Protestant,
yet she never dreamed of forbidding him the house;
and so, not being noticed, he grew tired of scoffing, and became
in time like other people. He told her Henri would probably
do the same; and pleaded, moreover, that his conduct had
been always regular and blameless, and could bring nothing
but credit to any one.”</p>

<p>“He says as much for him here,” said Ivan, reading from
Emile’s letter. “‘My cousin is really miserable about the soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
of her son, which she thinks to be in peril; while my grandmother
is only annoyed at what she considers a social degradation.
In the eyes of the one, Protestantism is heretical; in
those of the other, it is “bourgeoise.” My grandmother
fancies that Henri was demoralized by his campaign under the
Emperor’s standard, whereas Henri himself says that it was
only then he learned what religion meant. I cannot profess to
understand the matter, not being myself religious; but there
is certainly a curious connection, not to say confusion, between
saintliness and heresy. Henri is religious&mdash;he is “converted;”
yet he is called a heretic, and mourned over by your excellent
mother-in-law as next to an infidel, and on the highroad to perdition.
He has a fast friend in little Stéphanie, who takes
his part in season and out of season. I am rather glad of it;
for the child had almost ceased to be amusing, Madame de
Krudener tamed her so effectually.’&mdash;You must write to your
mother, Clémence,” said Ivan, laying down the letter, “and
pray her to be tender and patient with Henri.”</p>

<p>“<em>That</em> will be needless,” Clémence answered. “To my
mother Henri will be as a sick child who needs a fourfold share
of tenderness. I know her well. Fondly as she clung to him
before, he will be closer than ever to her now.&mdash;One thing is
certain, Ivan. We can no longer hope for a visit from her
next summer. Until Henri’s education as an architect is
finished, no power on earth will move her from his side. Our
only hope is that hereafter, through the kindness of the Emperor,
some work may be found for him in this country.”</p>

<p>“It <em>shall</em> be found,” said Ivan, in his bright, confident way.
“Here, at least, religious differences create no prejudice. A
man may profess what creed he pleases, so that he does not
outrage public order, or make proselytes from the national
Church. We Russians are very tolerant.”</p>

<p>“Is not toleration sometimes only indifference under a
mask?” asked Clémence. “Ah, when will men learn the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
secret of holding truth dearer than life, and yet being gentle
and patient with those who do not see it through their eyes?”</p>

<p>“Some secrets are only learned in ‘the secret place of the
Most High,’” Ivan answered softly.</p>

<p>Neither he nor Clémence was at all aware that they themselves
were slipping unconsciously from the moorings of their
own ancestral creeds, and that their study of the Scriptures was
bringing them nearer day by day to the present standpoint of
Henri.</p>

<p>Not long after this sorrow, joy came to the household.
When the first days of the short Russian summer smiled upon
Nicolofsky, a little guest was sent to the old castle. Very
proud was Ivan of his first-born child; and to Clémence it
seemed as if no one since the beginning of the world had ever
been so happy as she. It was agreed that the babe should bear
the name of Madame de Talmont; so a little “Rose” budded
soft and fair amidst the snows of Russia, giving promise of one
day unfolding its petals in full beauty and fragrance.</p>

<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_a.jpg" width="73" height="72" alt="" />
<span class="smcap1 a">A happy</span> quiet year passed away at Nicolofsky;
then Ivan and Clémence removed to St. Petersburg,
where they established themselves for the
coming winter in one of the palaces on the Fontanka.
Clémence, upon this her first visit, found the city
wonderful and fascinating in its very strangeness. It seemed
a thing of yesterday; the magnificent buildings, the stately
streets and squares, looked as if they had sprung into being at
the touch of an enchanter’s wand. Not yet had the hand of
time left its impress anywhere. When she arrived, all was
life, colour, animation; every pulse of the great city was throbbing,
and the din of its multitudinous and busy noises smote
strangely upon ears accustomed to the quiet of the country.
But soon a change came. The snow spread its soft white
mantle over the crowded thoroughfares, the sounds of traffic
were hushed, the steps of passers-by fell silently, and the
bright blue waters of the Neva were chained by the genii of
the frost. “It is like a city of the dead,” thought Clémence.</p>

<p>But she thought differently when Ivan took her, well wrapped
in furs, for her first winter drive in St. Petersburg. It was
pleasant to glide rapidly through the clear frosty air along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
Neva Prospekt, filled with glittering throngs on foot or in
gaily-decorated sledges. Costumes the most various and striking
showed that every race and kindred, from Persia and
Japan in the far East to the forests of America in the West,
had its representatives in that northern metropolis. Tartars
in their robes of fur, Cossacks in their hooded cloaks, mingled
with bearded Russians in blue caftans, and Englishmen and
Germans in the sober attire patronized by modern Europeans.
Officers in uniform were without number; and the robes of
ecclesiastics, Romish as well as Greek, diversified the scene;
while fair ladies, in elegant though slightly exaggerated Parisian
toilets, bowed from their sledges to their friends, or alighted
at the doors of the handsome and brilliantly-decorated shops.</p>

<p>Their life in the capital was full of interest to Clémence and
Ivan. The best and most brilliant society received them with
open arms. Ivan’s comrades in the late war gathered round
him, and many were their pleasant social meetings. Clémence
was soon presented at Court, and won the marked approval
of the dignified Empress Mother, and&mdash;what she prized much
more highly&mdash;the favour of the gentle Empress Elizabeth.
Both the Empresses found their chief enjoyment in assisting
the Emperor in his works of mercy. The more active disposition
of the elder led her to take delight in the management of
the great Foundling Hospital (her especial favourite); also in
the establishment for the education of young ladies; in the
School for the Deaf and Dumb, where the methods of the Abbé
Sicard were being carried out with diligence and success; and
in many other institutions, which were either founded or
fostered by the benevolence of Alexander. When the Winter
Palace set the example, it was no marvel that charity became
the fashion in St. Petersburg. Not from fashion, but from a
far higher motive, Clémence and Ivan engaged heartily in such
pursuits, spending much of their leisure and their substance in
the work of serving “Christ in his poor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
There were at this time in the best society of St. Petersburg
two distinct religious circles, differing widely, and each in its
own way very influential. At the Sardinian Embassy, the
“old man eloquent,” Count de Maistre,&mdash;with his white hair
and eyes of fire, his “esprit fin” indescribable in English, his
keen, quick sympathies, and his brave, high, chivalrous spirit,&mdash;strove
hard to turn the stream of religious thought into a
strong and steady current leading Romewards. He was worthy
to have been the champion of a better cause; but he and those
like him never really knew for what they were contending. They
were as loyal-hearted soldiers who fight and die heroically beneath
the banner of a usurper, honestly believing they are serving
their true king. Madame Svetchine, Countess Tolstoi, and
other devout women, were just then yielding to the fascination
of De Maistre’s eloquence; and a colony of Jesuits, zealous,
active, and not over-scrupulous, were furthering the work of
proselytism after their peculiar fashion.</p>

<p>Around Prince Galitzin, Alexander Tourgenieff, Princess
Metchersky, and others of a similar character, there gathered
a very different circle&mdash;earnest students of Scripture, simple
evangelical Christians, with whom faith and love were the fulfilling
of the law, and forms occupied a very subordinate place.
These were in constant communication with the leaders of the
evangelical movement in other countries, and especially with
the agents of the Bible Society. They knew themselves the
objects of suspicion and aversion, not only to the Romanizing
party, but also to the zealous members of the Greek Church,
the men of the old school, who were strongly attached to things
as they were, and jealous of all reform. But they were
strengthened by the knowledge that the heart of the Emperor
was with them, though his sense of justice made him endeavour
to hold the balance evenly between the contending parties, and
his natural attachment to the Church of which he was the head
deterred him from any course that he thought likely to endanger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
its stability or weaken its influence. Ivan from the
first, and eventually Clémence also, gave a decided preference
to the society of Galitzin and his friends; although they occasionally
frequented the Sardinian Embassy, and Clémence found
a warm personal friend in the Countess Tolstoi.</p>

<p>The Christmas festivities drew on, and Clémence and Ivan
were amongst the guests invited to the grand ball and supper
given at the Winter Palace to celebrate the Emperor’s birthday.
Ivan was extremely anxious that Clémence should be
present at one of these magnificent entertainments, which had
all the brilliancy imperial wealth and splendour could give, with
the addition of what does not always accompany them&mdash;the charm
of exquisite taste and “sovereign elegance.” He returned from
the levee, where he had spent most of the day, in high
spirits and full of pleasurable anticipation. But his surprise
was great to find Clémence, still in her usual dress, bending
with a troubled face over the cot in which their little Rosebud
lay.</p>

<p>“Surely there is nothing wrong with our darling?” he said,
stooping tenderly over the sleeping babe. “It cannot be. She
was so bright and full of life when I left you this morning.”</p>

<p>“There is something wrong,” Clémence whispered, looking
up, but scarcely stirring, for the little hand of the sleeping child
had closed about her mother’s finger. “I cannot but be anxious,
since that terrible attack of croup she had when the cold weather
began. Listen!&mdash;her breathing is still quick, though quieter
now than an hour ago. But I must be here to do what is
wanted&mdash;and to do it at once. I <em>cannot</em> go with you, Ivan,” she
said pleadingly.</p>

<p>Ivan was greatly disappointed, but he would not combat his
wife’s resolve. After a pause, he said gently, “It shall be as
you like, dearest. I see little Rosebud is stronger than the
Czar.”</p>

<p>“Say all that is right for me,” Clémence continued. “But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
I don’t think you will have any trouble there. We have
not only imperial courtesy to deal with, but kind hearts and
true.”</p>

<p>“Hearts that often bleed beneath their purple trappings,”
Ivan answered. “The Empress Elizabeth does not appear at
this ball: she is mourning to-night for the death of a little girl
whom she had adopted, and to whom she was tenderly attached.
‘Every one dies in whom I take an interest,’ she says. Perhaps
her own frail health makes her look the more sorrowfully upon
all things. Pray for her, Clémence.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I will. How the happy ought to pray for those
on whom life’s shadows seem to fall! <em>We</em> have all sunshine,
Ivan.”</p>

<p>But even then a shadow was falling over their happy home.
The little Rosebud, so lovingly watched and tended, was fading
quickly. When Ivan returned that night from the Winter
Palace, with its splendour, its lights, its music, his own dwelling
was hushed and still. The Master had come for their treasure.
Unmurmuringly, though with tearful eyes and aching hearts,
they gave it into his keeping. They might have said, had they
known the <span class="locked">words,&mdash;</span></p>

<span class="smcap1 t">Two</span> or three weeks later Clémence sat alone one
afternoon. A bright wood fire burned on the
hearth, and on a little table near her lay a pile of
needlework&mdash;garments for the poor. But just then
she was occupied with a letter from her mother, written in
happy unconsciousness of the sorrow which had fallen upon her
dear ones; and she could not help a few tears which dropped
quietly upon the page, full of questions and remarks about their
little Rosebud.</p>

<p>While she was reading Ivan came in, with more brightness
in his face and animation in his step than had been there since
Christmas eve. But he saw the tears, and stooping down kissed
her tenderly.</p>

<p>“What is it, m’amie?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“These letters, dear,” she answered, looking up with the
smile of welcome <em>his</em> entrance never failed to win from her.
“My mother’s is about our Rosebud.” After a pause and a
little sigh she added, “The only important news she tells us is
that our friend M. de Sartines is dead.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! I am very sorry.”</p>

<p>“So am I, especially for Stéphanie. She has written to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
herself, poor child&mdash;a long letter, but I have not read it
yet.”</p>

<p>“Does our mother give any particulars?” asked Ivan.</p>

<p>“Only that his illness was a short one&mdash;inflammation on the
lungs. She says Stéphanie has behaved admirably, tending her
father bravely and carefully, and watching beside him to the
very end. She is almost heart-broken.”</p>

<p>“Poor little one!&mdash;How lonely she must be! I wish we
could bring her here. <em>You</em> would comfort her, Clémence.”</p>

<p>Ivan paused; then resumed, with a slight touch of uneasiness
in his voice, “M’amie, will it trouble you if a friend comes to
visit us to-night?”</p>

<p>A look of pain passed swiftly over the face of Clémence.
The sorrowing heart is prone to shrink within itself, and to
dread the first breath of outer air, the first touch of common
life. “Not if it is only an intimate friend,” she said at last,
“such as M. Tolstoi or M. Adrian Wertsch; but I should not
quite care to see a stranger, Ivan.”</p>

<p>“It is no stranger; it is one whom we both love.” Then he
returned rather nervously to the subject of the letters, asking
what would become of Stéphanie.</p>

<p>“For the present she is to be sent to the pension where her
cousin Coralie is,” Clémence answered. “Her uncle, who is
now her guardian, appears to wish it, and she herself is indifferent.
La Tante has not been very well of late, Ivan; she seems
to be in low spirits, but I am thankful to say she is becoming
reconciled to Henri’s change; and he, for his part, writes very
cheerfully. The best judges in the profession he has adopted
think highly of his talent. He has just gained some prize for
a design;&mdash;but I have not yet finished reading his letter.”</p>

<p>So they talked on, until at last Ivan suggested preparations
for tea, and rather to the surprise of Clémence interested himself
in them in a way quite foreign to his usual habits. She
only looked at him wonderingly, and with a little amusement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
as he arranged and rearranged the tea-table; but when he
actually began to make inquiries about the quality of the beverage
itself, her eyes, so lately tearful, sparkled into a smile as
she <span class="locked">asked,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“When did <em>you</em> become a connoisseur in these things, Ivan?
I thought the difference between tea and coffee was the extent
of your knowledge on the subject.”</p>

<p>Ivan, instead of answering, kissed her; then taking a white
camellia from a vase on the table, he fastened it at the throat
of her plain black dress. “My Clémence must look her best to
receive the Emperor,” he said.</p>

<p>“The <em>Emperor</em>!” she cried in dismay. “Oh, Ivan, why did
you not tell me?”</p>

<p>Before he could reply a sledge stopped at the door, and Ivan
hastened down to welcome his guest.</p>

<p>Clémence had scarcely recovered her composure when the
Emperor entered the room, saying <span class="locked">pleasantly,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I must make my apologies to Madame la Princesse for inviting
myself. Prince Ivan Ivanovitch is responsible: he gave
me permission to take you by surprise, and promised me a
welcome.”</p>

<p>The promised welcome was given by Clémence, very gracefully
and cordially, in spite of a little tremulousness in her
voice and nervousness in her manner. One gentle, significant
word of sympathy for her sorrow was spoken; then, all ceremony
being waived, they took their seats together at the table, the
Emperor declining the “fauteuil” Ivan placed for him, and
choosing an ordinary chair instead.</p>

<p>“You know I am deaf,” he said; “let me sit where I can
best hear the voice of madame.”<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
As, with a hand still trembling, Clémence poured out the tea,
she remembered the stories she had heard of such evening visits
made by the Emperor, “to talk at his ease,” and recalled the
words of De Maistre when some one criticised this habit in his
presence: “It is a touching thing to me to see the ruler of a
great empire, in the age of all the passions, find his recreation
in taking a cup of tea with an honest man and his wife.”</p>

<p>In the meantime her place behind the “samovar” was no
sinecure, for the Emperor drank many cups of tea, while he
talked earnestly with Ivan upon the things of which his heart was
full&mdash;schools, hospitals, and prison reforms. He soon drew
Clémence into the conversation. Her interest in the institutions
of St. Petersburg was evidently well known to him, and
he asked her opinion on various matters of detail, especially
about the school for the deaf and dumb. Then they talked of
primary schools, and of the Lancastrian system, which he had
sent commissioners to England to investigate with a view of
adopting it in Russia. This led to the general subject of education,
which he remarked ought not to be merely mechanical, but
adapted to the development of the intelligence.</p>

<p>“Some teachers would turn their pupils into absolute
machines,” he said, “by way of levelling their path to knowledge.”</p>

<p>Here the soft voice of Clémence broke in. “Ought not
religion to be the foundation of all education?” she asked somewhat
timidly.</p>

<p>“If education is, properly speaking, the extension of light,”
said the Emperor, “surely it ought first of all to extend the true
light&mdash;the light that shineth in darkness.”</p>

<p>As a means to this end, he spoke of the translation of the
Bible into the vulgar tongue, a work which he was then urging
forward with all his influence. He gratefully acknowledged the
services of the noble British and Foreign Bible Society, and
spoke with enthusiasm of that and other agencies which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
promoting the cause of Christ throughout the world. The
extent and accuracy of his knowledge of missionary work
astonished Clémence and Ivan. They learned afterwards that
every Saturday morning Prince Galitzin used to bring him, by
his own desire, all the information on the subject he could
obtain during the week. It was from the study of the Divine
Word that he had himself obtained light and comfort; and
therefore, as he said, he “reckoned it his most sacred duty” to
disseminate that word.</p>

<p>Clémence, who had been a little disturbed by the warnings
of De Maistre and other enemies of the Bible Society about the
danger of misinterpreting Scripture, ventured to ask whether it
might not be well to associate some simple commentary with the
text of the Bible.</p>

<p>“Commentaries have this inconvenience,” he said in reply,
“that they substitute more or less for the text of Scripture the
ideas of some one who interprets it according to his own system.
These ideas will not be accepted by all. But it ought to be the
aim of every Christian, whatever communion he may belong to,
to allow the sacred Code in all its extent to act upon him with
perfect freedom. This action cannot be otherwise than beneficent
and stimulating, as may be expected from a divine book&mdash;from
the Book of books.”</p>

<p>“Where there is faith to receive it,” Ivan threw in, “it produces
in all alike certain great results, yet with important
differences.”</p>

<p>“True,” he resumed. “Its action will be different in each
individual, and just because of this difference is it grand and
extraordinary. It makes of each individual whatever it is
possible to make of him with regard to his particular nature.
Is not unity in variety the grand point at which we seek to
arrive, in order to secure the prosperity of Churches and of
States? Everywhere in external nature we see this principle
of unity in variety, and we perceive it also in the history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
nations: only, we must not take for a measure the short space
of our own lives; it is to ages and decades of ages we must look
when we seek to judge of the result of a great struggle between
opposing forces. Upon all the children of time and of party
spirit&mdash;such as contradictions, lies, vain interpretations&mdash;time
itself does justice; they evaporate like foam, and are gone.
Truth remains. But the action of truth is slow; often centuries
elapse before it is accepted. Still it makes way; the means
exist not of sealing it hermetically, as some would do with the
Holy Scriptures. Do not the rays of the sun make their way?
and those who live in their brightness are the children of
light.”<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>No one cared to break the silence that followed these eager,
burning words. The same thought was throbbing in the heart
of Clémence and of Ivan&mdash;that it was a grand and beautiful
thing, a precious gift of God, to be allowed to work for that
great future victory of truth and light. “But how little a
woman can do,” Clémence thought sadly. “Still, every word
and deed of kindness, every message of divine love passed on to
one poor waiting soul, helps the cause as truly as does the Czar
himself in throwing wide open before the Bible the gates of his
vast empire.” Almost before she was aware, she had uttered
something of her thought.</p>

<p>“Ah, but you would be wrong indeed to think yourself useless,”
said the Emperor in his courteous way. “Good women
are true benefactors of society, by their example and the influence
of their virtues. In their presence one seems to breathe
a purer moral atmosphere.”</p>

<p>“I think, sire,” said Ivan, “that every human soul possesses
influence, even the soul of a little child.”</p>

<p>His thoughts, and those of Clémence also, turned to an
empty cot in the next room. Quiet talk followed, of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
their little one was the theme,&mdash;sweet converse about “the
ransom for that baby paid,” and the home to which she had
been taken. It was truly “from very heart to very heart”
that hour. At last the Emperor rose to take his leave; and
not until then did Clémence venture to say something that <em>must</em>
be said&mdash;something that she might reproach herself all her life
if she lost this opportunity of saying.</p>

<p>“Sire, I have one brother, dear to me as my own soul, and
he charged me solemnly, if ever I had the privilege of speaking
with your Majesty face to face, to tell you that he will bless
until his latest hour <em>the aide-de-camp of St. Priest</em>.” Then in a
few brief words she told the story of Henri’s deliverance.</p>

<p>The Czar was much moved. Not so often did the blessings
of the many he tried to bless reach his ears. His successor
might well say that he “had before his eyes, in his brother, the
example of a sovereign whose whole existence was an incessant
sacrifice to duty, and who nevertheless had so seldom succeeded
in securing even gratitude, at least from his contemporaries.”
Yet we have evidence that when gratitude came to him he
found it very sweet. After a pause, he said <span class="locked">gently,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Madame, I have only done my duty. What is called the
right of reprisal has always seemed terrible to me. The only
revenge we ought to take is in doing good.”</p>

<p>By this time the Emperor’s famous coachman, Ilya, who had
spent the evening with the servants of Ivan, a much-honoured
and fêted guest, had in readiness the unpretending sledge in
which his imperial master drove about his capital.</p>

<p>“Have you forgiven me, dearest?” asked Ivan, when he
returned from attending their august visitor to the door. “It
is the first time I ever kept a secret from you.”</p>

<p>Clémence looked in his radiant face, and her only answer was
a smile.</p>

<p>“He is charmed with you,” Ivan went on delighted. “I
knew it would be so. He admired you even the first day he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
saw you&mdash;the day of the review in the Plaine des Vertus. How
well he looks, does he not, Clémence?”</p>

<p>“Yes; well, but worn; and there is a weary look in his
eyes. I think he needs rest, Ivan.”</p>

<p>Ivan shook his head a little sadly. “Do you know where he
is going now?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Home, I suppose; it is midnight.”</p>

<p>“Ilya tells our people he is going to visit the hospitals. He
goes sometimes at midnight, to ascertain that the patients are
as well cared for by night as by day.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> Yet to-morrow morning
at six o’clock he will be in his cabinet or on parade.”</p>

<p>“The light that shines must burn, and burn out,” said
Clémence. “But, Ivan,” she added with hesitation, “may I
say something?”</p>

<p>“What thing is there which you may <em>not</em> say, my Clémence?”</p>

<p>“There is one thing which you would not hear from any lip
on earth&mdash;a word of blame for your Czar. But do not think I
mean it so if I ask, could not some life less precious be found
to spend itself in these ministrations? Would not he do well
to remember the warning of Jethro&mdash;‘Thou wilt surely wear
away, thou, and this people that is with thee; for this thing
is too heavy for thee’?”</p>

<p>“Clémence, you do not know our Russians. I love them
well, yet I see their faults, which are something like those of
clever, ill-educated children, but on a gigantic scale. They are,
when they choose it, the most accomplished of deceivers. They
can elaborate and carry out a fraud with a patient ingenuity,
a consummate dexterity, that one is tempted to call quite
artistic. When the Czarina Catherine travelled through the
empire, her courtiers of course wished her to imagine it in a
state of the highest prosperity; so they erected mock villages
along her route, and drove to the neighbourhood herds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
cattle, and troops of well-dressed peasants to greet her with
smiles and acclamations. It takes all the vigilance of my Czar,
and all his careful personal inspection, to guard against similar
deceptions; and I fear that even he does not always succeed.”</p>

<p>“Is not the remedy for this want of truth, as for other evils,
to be found in the dissemination of the Word of truth?” asked
Clémence.</p>

<p>“Surely it is,” said Ivan with a brightening look. “Do you
not feel, Clémence, as if the spring were come,&mdash;as if every plant
were budding with new, glorious life? Amongst the princes of
the earth, one says, ‘I am the Lord’s;’ another subscribes with
his hand unto the Lord, and surnames himself by the name of
the God of Israel. His Word is loved, honoured, scattered
broadcast amongst the people. Think of the joy of having it
in our common tongue, Clémence&mdash;the tongue in which the
babe lisps to its mother, and the gray-haired mujik tells his
stories of the past as he sits beside his stove! Soon, I hope,
in the izbas of every village throughout the length and breadth
of our land, the father will be reading to the children the story
of their Saviour’s love. I learned to-day two things which
rejoiced my heart about the home I have never ceased to love&mdash;holy
Moscow, the city of our solemnities.”</p>

<p>“Tell them to me, Ivan.”</p>

<p>“One is a joy to me upon grounds purely personal, and I
think it will please you also. As an ornament for the restored
city, the Czar is about to raise a stately monument to the
memory of my patriotic ancestor and his brave associate. ‘To
Prince Pojarsky and Citizen Minim, from grateful Russia,’ so
runs the simple and noble inscription. But, what is far better,
he has just given to the Bible Society, for its storehouse and
head-quarters, that great old building which was formerly the
office of the secret police. Think of Bibles being laid up in
what used to be the torture-chamber! How quickly and how
gloriously the rays of the Sun of Righteousness are rising upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
us! They are flooding with light even those dark places of
the earth which used to be the habitations of cruelty.”</p>

<p>“But is there not something else still to be wished for, Ivan?
Those free Bibles you speak of, should you not wish to see
them read and loved by free peasants?”</p>

<p>“That is coming too,” said Ivan, with rapt look and confident
voice. “Every one who knows the Czar knows that his
cherished dream&mdash;his favourite, his ruling idea&mdash;is now, as
it has ever been, the emancipation of the serfs.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> Through
the facilities he has afforded and the encouragement he has
given, many have been freed already. Count Sergius Romanzoff,
for instance, has given liberty to all his serfs.”</p>

<p>“And why not Prince Ivan Pojarsky?” asked Clémence in a
low voice, as she laid her hand on his arm and looked earnestly
into his face.</p>

<p>“You utter the voice of my own heart, Clémence. Often
have I thought of this. But&mdash;” He broke off his unfinished
sentence, and began to pace the room with rapid footsteps.</p>

<p>Clémence took up the last word. “But&mdash;there are many
difficulties,” she said.</p>

<p>“One is quite sufficient, for the present,” Ivan pursued.
“The people of Nicolofsky are not fit for greater freedom than
they have now; they would not know how to use it. Let us
train them for it,” he added as he stopped before her chair.</p>

<p>“Which already we are trying to do, are we not?” asked
Clémence.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “That is God’s work for us. Part of it.
There is work here, too&mdash;noble, blessed work. How good it is
of our Father in heaven to cast our lot in such times as these,
Clémence. Surely they are the last times, when ‘the mountain
of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains,
and shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
flow unto it;’ when ‘they shall teach no more every man his
neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord:
for all shall know him, from the least to the greatest.’&mdash;Surely
we shall live to see that blessed consummation, you and I.”</p>

<p>In the bright enthusiasm of their youth they forgot the
words of Alexander, “It is to ages and decades of ages we
must look;” nor perhaps did he always remember them himself.
But the next thought of Clémence was one very natural
to the still aching heart of the bereaved mother. “If only our
little Rosebud could have lived to see it too,” she said.</p>

<p>“Ay,” said Ivan. Then after a pause he added, “But she
sees Christ, which is far better.”</p>

<span class="smcap1 b">Bright</span> days followed for Clémence and Ivan&mdash;days
of noble striving and endeavour, of “taking root
downwards” in thought and experience, and of
“bearing fruit upwards” in loving helpful toil for
others. Their little Rosebud was not forgotten. The baby
guest whose visit was so brief that it seemed to come and go
like a dream left an abiding blessing behind her. Heaven
looked nearer and more real to the parents whose treasure was
there already; and labour felt more sweet for Him who had
her in his keeping. Thenceforward the tender, introspective
spirit of Clémence grew more and more into the glad undoubting
faith of Ivan. Nor did the little cot remain empty; for
God sent them other gifts&mdash;in the course of the next three
years two baby boys came to gladden their home.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the stirrings of new life seemed to pervade ever
more and more the land in which they lived. It was something
like what the early Reformation era had been in the elder
lands of Europe. Nor was it only the rich and great who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
shared the blessing; to the poor also the gospel was preached.
One morning late in spring, when the frost and snow had at
last disappeared and the Neva was navigable again, Ivan stood
on the quay watching what was then to the inhabitants of St.
Petersburg a strange sight and new. Amidst the numerous
boats that cleft the blue waters with the aid of sail and oar
came an unfamiliar monster, panting and puffing on its rapid
way with an air of conscious power, while a dense column of
steam issuing from its funnel bore witness to the triumph of
modern science. Ivan gazed and wondered, until his attention
was distracted by an exclamation in a voice he knew&mdash;“<em>Great
St. Nicholas!</em>”</p>

<p>Turning a little, he saw beside him a sergeant of artillery,
who was lifting up one hand in amazement.</p>

<p>“Michael Ivanovitch!” he cried. “I am heartily glad to
see you. And so you have got your promotion,” he added,
touching his epaulette.</p>

<p>“Yes, Barrinka; and two orders,” returned Michael, proudly
showing the badges to Ivan. “We have just been sent here
from Moscow, where we were stationed since September twelve-months.”</p>

<p>“You must come home with me,” said Ivan. “My wife
will be delighted to see you. She will send an account of your
visit to your mother; for she writes a long letter every fortnight
to Pope Nikita, with messages for half Nicolofsky.”</p>

<p>“I shall soon be able to write to my mother myself, Barrinka,”
said Michael with an air of pride as he walked beside
Ivan to the Fontanka. “It only takes one hand to do that,”
he explained.</p>

<p>“But it takes learning,” returned Ivan laughing. “I did
not know you were a scholar, Michael.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, Barrinka; there is a school in our regiment now,
and we are learning to read and write. Barrinka, is it true
that the words of the blessed Lord,” he asked, crossing himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
“will soon be all turned into Russ and put into a printed book,
which any poor man like me will be able to read if only he
knows his kirillitza?”<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>“Quite true; I have myself seen the translation of the Four
Gospels.”</p>

<p>“I have a little bit of it already. See, Barrinka.” He
took from his pocket a printed copy of extracts from the New
Testament. These had been selected by the excellent Quakers
Allen and Grellet, printed by the Emperor’s express orders,
and distributed for use in all the primary schools which he had
established in the army and throughout the empire.</p>

<p>“It is full of the most beautiful things about the blessed Bog
Sūn,” continued Michael: “how he healed the sick and gave
sight to the blind; how he died for our sins, and rose again the
third day; and how every one who believes in him will get a
free pardon for his sake, and have part in the resurrection of
the just. What a wonderful thing it is for a poor man to be
able to read all this for himself, just as well as if he were a pope
or a monk! One of my comrades has a book too, written by
an Englishman, which the Czar himself got turned into Russ&mdash;it
is called ‘No Cross, no Crown.’<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> Besides telling how the
Son of God bore the cross for us, it tells how we must bear any
cross he sends us for his sake; and how, if we follow him here,
we shall have a crown of glory by-and-by in his kingdom,&mdash;a
crown of glory, like the Czar! Only think of that, Barrinka!
I can scarcely make up my mind to believe it; and I am longing
to get <em>all</em> the words of Christ to read for myself, that I may
know if it is true. But, to be sure, the Czar must know.”</p>

<p>“To be sure he knows! It is all true, Michael; I can show
you the words myself in which it is promised, and read them
with you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how good of you! Still, I am thinking that rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
than be a king myself up yonder&mdash;which is what I am no way
fit for&mdash;I would like to go on serving the Czar there, as I do
here. Would not you, Barrinka?”</p>

<p>“I think so <em>now</em>. But how it will be with me then I cannot
tell. ‘It doth not yet appear what we shall be.’ Christ’s
promise is enough: ‘I will give thee a crown of life’&mdash;‘To
him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne.’
Yet is it said too, ‘They serve him day and night in his temple.’”</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the gate of Ivan’s palace.
Clémence gladly renewed her acquaintance with the friend of
her husband’s boyhood; she gave him a hospitable welcome, and,
to his intense delight, showed him her two lovely boys, the elder
just able to lisp his father’s name, the younger a three months’
babe in the cradle.</p>

<p>From that time Ivan’s old playfellow was a frequent visitor.
Clémence helped him in the studies of which he was so proud;
and they had many a quiet happy talk together about Him of
whom the Book they loved so well testified in every page.
Eventually, however, the current of their lives divided, and
swept them apart, never probably to meet again on this side of
the grave. But the lessons they had learned remained with
both, and both in their several spheres sought to pass them on
to others. Many years afterwards, a German traveller<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> in
Russia visited the churches of St. Petersburg, as an interested
spectator of the touching Russian custom of the reading of the
Scriptures on Easter eve by the people for one another. He
tells us that in one of these churches he saw a veteran soldier,
scarred and weather-beaten, standing at the desk with a taper
in his hand reading the story of his Saviour’s death to a company
of little children who clustered around him, listening to
the sacred words with absorbed and breathless attention.
Perhaps he failed to notice, or perhaps he did not think it worth
while to chronicle, that the reader had lost a hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
Never can it be known, until the great day of revelation, how
many hearts at this epoch received life and blessing from the
Word of God, scattered broadcast throughout the great Russian
Empire, not only with the approbation, but with the earnest
personal co-operation, of its monarch. “For,” said Alexander,
“I consider this undertaking not merely worthy of my attention;
no, I am penetrated by it to the inmost recesses of my soul.
And I reckon the promotion of it my most sacred duty, because
on it depends the temporal and eternal happiness of
those whom Providence has committed to my care. Blessed
are those who take a part in it; for such gather fruit unto life
eternal, when those who sow and those who reap shall rejoice
together.”<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>But he who uttered these noble words in all the glow and
ardour of his first love, had soon cause to remember that the
bearer of the precious seed too often goes on his way weeping.
As time wore on it became apparent that the hand of the
enemy was busy sowing tares with it. Religious activity began
to fulfil its inevitable condition by engendering religious dissension.
Doubts and perplexities arose, and the noise of angry
controversies filled the air. Many devout and noble spirits,
alienated by the stiff mechanical formalism of the Eastern
ritual, turned their longing eyes towards the West, where stood
great Babylon with the golden cup in her hand wherewith she
deceived the nations by her sorceries. They knew her doctrines
very imperfectly, her history not at all. Hence they yielded
too readily to the baleful fascination; and at length the perversions
grew so numerous that even the tolerant Czar was obliged
to interfere. He banished the Jesuits&mdash;the most active promoters
of proselytism&mdash;first from the two capitals, eventually
from the empire. This step cost him some dear and valued
friends; nor were all as generous and discriminating as De
Maistre, who could say, even when he thought he had lost the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
favour of Alexander, “I am as sure of his justice as of his
existence.”</p>

<p>From Madame de Krudener and her coterie he was also
forced to separate himself. They criticised his public policy,
and endeavoured to prescribe to him the line of action he ought
to pursue, especially with regard to the Greeks. Alexander
never forgot the past: he treated Madame de Krudener with
great gentleness and forbearance, and never ceased to show her
thoughtful personal kindness; but he had to tell her that he
could allow no interference with his duties as monarch.</p>

<p>Nor was this the worst. All was not sunshine in the path
of evangelical reform; and even the dissemination of the Word
of truth did not seem to bring with it the unalloyed blessing
that had at first been anticipated. On the contrary, there
appeared to be some foundation for the gloomy forebodings of
De Maistre, who, as a Roman Catholic, saw in the Bible Society
only a means for overturning the whole ecclesiastical establishment
of Russia. “Protestants on one side and Raskolniks<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> on
the other,” said he, “are two files which saw the religion of the
country at each end, and they must soon meet.” Everywhere
the new wine was fermenting and threatening to rend the old
bottles. Ignorant soldiers and peasants rushed into wild
forms of fanatical dissent, or tore down and destroyed sacred
pictures, justifying their acts out of the Russian Testaments
their Czar himself had distributed amongst them. Photi,
and other zealots of the Greek Church,&mdash;who had their own
reasons for dreading the influx of evangelical light,&mdash;eagerly
took advantage of these disorders, not only to denounce such
men as Galitzin and Tourgenieff, “who defy us the heirs of the
apostles,” but to ask the official head of the national Church
whether he intended to stand by and see her torn to pieces, nay,
himself to assist in the work of destruction?</p>

<p>This was a question Alexander certainly could not answer in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
the affirmative. It is evident that he loved the Church of his
fathers; that he thought her superstitions mere excrescences
which might be removed without seriously endangering her
fabric; that he believed her maintenance necessary to the welfare
of his people; and that he knew there was nothing ready
to replace her. Hence his course of action satisfied no one;
he earned the envenomed abuse of the bigots of the Greek
Church, who traced all the disorders of the country to the
translation of the Bible and the education of the poor; while
at the same time he did not quite fulfil the sanguine expectations
of the friends of evangelical light and progress. But
after all, this does not matter so greatly. The important
question is, how far he satisfied the Master in whose presence
he tried to walk. This is not for us to decide; but at least we
know that no influence, no persuasion, ever moved him to withdraw
his help and countenance from the Bible Society, or to
allow its work to be impeded in any way.</p>

<p>As for Clémence and Ivan, the Romanizing party had never
possessed any attraction for the latter, while the former was
gradually receding from the creed in which she had been brought
up. But the conflict between the Evangelical and what was
called the “Orthodox” party was of deep interest to them both.
They went heartily along with Galitzin and his friends; Ivan
was even sometimes tempted to go beyond them, and altogether
to snap the cords that bound him to the national Church.
The superstitious practices which prevail in the Eastern
Church, as well as in that of the West, cost him many
keen and bitter “searchings of heart.” He was especially
troubled about the adoration of saints and angels and of sacred
pictures. Often did he talk upon these matters with Clémence,
and earnestly did they pray that they might “perceive and
know what things they ought to do.”</p>

<p>Ivan’s search after a pure form of faith might have led him
further had not a bond, invisible yet most strong, held him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
the Church of which his Czar was the head. Ivan thought that
if reform were really needed, he would surely be her leader
also. His soul refused, in its tender, passionate loyalty, to pass
beyond that of the man he loved. Therein he erred. To each
one of us who closely follows the Divine teaching an hour is
sure to come when, in the true spirit of Christ’s command, we
learn to call no man our father upon earth&mdash;when we can no
longer take truth upon trust, even from the dearest and most
venerated of human lips. Moreover, Ivan expected from
Alexander what from his position alone, if from no other
reason, he was incapable of performing. King Arthur could
not ride forth along with his knights in quest of the Holy
Grail; the place in which God had put him, the work to which
He had called him, rendered it impossible.</p>

<p>For three or four years Ivan and Clémence continued to
spend the winters in St. Petersburg, the summers for the most
part at Nicolofsky. Here their labours were amply rewarded.
From year to year they observed a satisfactory change in the
condition of their people; and so great did this appear at last
that Ivan said, “I think, my Clémence, they are almost fit
for freedom now.”</p>

<p>“But, Ivan,” said Clémence, “I am not sure that we are fit
to give it to them now.”</p>

<p>“Why not, m’amie?”</p>

<p>“For whom would we do it, Ivan? <em>For Alexander, or for
Christ?</em>”</p>

<p>Ivan was silent; the shaft had struck home. At length he
answered, “It is for Christ we must do it, Clémence. And he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
will help us.” After another long and thoughtful pause, he added,
“It is better, perhaps, to wait until the village boys whom we
have put to school have completed their education.”</p>

<p>“That will take five or six years.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ivan with a smile, “before then, perhaps, all
the mujiks throughout the land may be free men, and my Czar
have won the desire of his heart! Who knows?”</p>

<img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_o.jpg" width="73" height="72" alt="" />
<span class="smcap1 o">One</span> afternoon, in the spring of 1821, Clémence sat in
her boudoir, a bright, pleasant room of the palace
on the Fontanka, tastefully but not gaudily furnished.
A lovely boy between three and four
years old lay on the floor playing with an ivory alphabet. He
was dressed à la mujik, his long curls of gold fell over a miniature
caftan of fine blue cloth, which a sash of crimson silk bound
about his waist. A younger child, in a white frock of some
warm soft material edged with fur, sat on his mother’s knee;
and a great deal of baby chatter went on, which was rendered
still more unintelligible by being half Russian and half
French.</p>

<p>On the table beside Clémence lay a pile of books, with which
she had been occupying herself. They were copies of the Four
Gospels in Russ; and it was her pleasant task to write in
each the name of a mujik of Nicolofsky who had been enterprising
enough to learn the art of reading, and also to mark
such passages and verses as she thought would be particularly
profitable for study. But little Feodor’s fancy for suddenly
grasping the pen in her hand had put a stop for the present to
her labours.</p>

<p>Some one knocked at the door; and, thinking it was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
children’s nurse, she said, “Come in,” without looking up.
An attendant entered instead, announcing a visitor&mdash;“M. de
Salgues.”</p>

<p>In delighted amazement Clémence stood up, placed Feodor
on the ground, and hastened to welcome a guest who seemed a
part of her dear native land. “This is an unexpected pleasure,
and a very great one,” she said, warmly grasping the hand of
Emile.</p>

<p>But Emile, with his old effrontery, saluted her on the cheek,
saying, “Permettez-moi, madame ma cousine.”</p>

<p>A few explanations followed. Clémence and Ivan knew
already that Emile intended to visit them; for he was about
to make the tour of the European capitals, and had, as he
himself expressed it, every possible inducement not to omit
St. Petersburg. But the time of his visit having been left
uncertain, it had pleased him to surprise his friends by travelling
rapidly and directly from Paris to the city of the Czar.</p>

<p>“You will be glad to hear that my grandmother’s health has
improved,” he said in answer to the inquiries of Clémence.
“Madame de Talmont also is very well; and your brother is
flourishing, in every sense of the word. I have a portmanteau
full of letters and packages for you. How is Prince Ivan?”</p>

<p>“Well, thank you. I am sorry he is out just now; but I
expect him home in an hour or two.&mdash;My little son, ring the
bell for thy mother.”</p>

<p>The little mujik, who had been looking at the stranger with
large, blue, wide-open eyes, instantly obeyed.</p>

<p>“Come here, my little man,” said Emile, stretching out his
arms to him. “What a fine boy! Ma cousine, is this your
eldest?”</p>

<p>“My first-born is in heaven, as you know,” said Clémence in
a voice low and gentle, but not sad. “This is our eldest boy&mdash;Alexander.”</p>

<p>The little Alexander came willingly to Emile, and considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
it quite the proper thing to be kissed by him; for had he not
just seen him bestow a similar attention upon “Maman”?</p>

<p>Emile looked admiringly at the child’s handsome face, as he
seated him on his knee and gave him a bunch of seals to play
with. “He is like his father,” said he; “while his brother
resembles you,” he added, glancing at Feodor. “There is no
mistaking those soft dark eyes with the long silken lashes.
What is his name, ma cousine?”</p>

<p>“Feodor; in memory of the noble old man who was to his
father as a father.”</p>

<p>Just then a servant entered; and Clémence, finding that
Emile had left his luggage at a hotel, had it sent for, and gave
the other directions hospitality required. Meanwhile, Emile
carried on a conversation with the little mujik on his knee;
who, not in the least shy, put his hand on the breast of his
coat, and then tried to unbutton it, saying, “Where is your
star&mdash;the beautiful, shiny thing, all made of sparks of fire?”</p>

<p>“That must be a star of diamonds,” laughed Emile. “Is
that the sort of plaything <em>you</em> are accustomed to, my little
prince?”</p>

<p>“That is what my godfather wears on his coat, and he gives
it to me to play with when he comes here,” said the little
fellow, adding some unintelligible semi-Russian, which quite
baffled Emile.</p>

<p>“He has the honour to be the Emperor’s godson,” Clémence
explained.</p>

<p>“Then, my boy, you have a splendid godfather,” said Emile.</p>

<p>“Et bon,”<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> the child added quickly.</p>

<p>At this moment the nurse appeared at the door. She was a
stately personage in full Russian costume&mdash;a velvet “sarafan,”
or wide open robe, showing beneath it a close-fitting silken gown,
its long sleeves clasped at the wrist with bands of gold, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
the national head-dress, a kind of crescent-shaped diadem called
a “kakoshnik,” added to the magnificence of her appearance.
She was a person of great importance in the establishment,
and much beloved by the children, as they showed by going to
her without reluctance even from their idolized “Maman” or
“Matinka,” as they called her indifferently.</p>

<p>Whilst Emile was doing justice to a repast, which, although
prepared upon short notice, proved that Clémence had forgotten
none of his boyish tastes, he gave her various items of family
tidings, which were new to her, as she had not heard very
recently from home.</p>

<p>“My grandmother has been rather fortunate,” he said.
“Some mines in which she invested a portion of her salvage
from the wreck of the family fortunes have proved a grand
success. So the good soul was desirous of purchasing an estate
in the country upon which a certain ‘mauvais sujet’ of a
grandson, who has given her more trouble than he is worth,
might settle down at last and ‘range himself,’ as she says. By
a singular piece of good luck, the ancestral estate of your
branch of the Talmonts happened to be in the market, its
late republican possessor having made the country too hot for
himself.”</p>

<p>Clémence uttered an exclamation of surprise and pleasure.
“Has La Tante succeeded in obtaining it?” she asked eagerly
and with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma cousine. And the first work undertaken by the
promising young architect, M. de Talmont, is to be the restoration
of the old château.”</p>

<p>“Where we were born, he and I&mdash;where my mother spent
the brief, bright days of her wedded life!” said the delighted
Clémence. “Mon cousin, I rejoice to think that a place so
dear to us all will be your home. You must soon bring a fair
bride to grace it,” she added with a smile.</p>

<p>But Emile’s brow darkened. “I have no such thoughts at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
present,” he answered hastily. “Nor ever will,” he added in
a lower voice.</p>

<p>Clémence saw that she had touched an open wound; and, to
change the conversation, began to ask about Henri.</p>

<p>“He goes on splendidly,” said Emile. “Some folk are
born on the sunny side of the world, like your little lad, who
plays with diamonds from his cradle.”</p>

<p>This tone surprised Clémence. An ordinary observer would
have thought both the past and present fortunes of Emile far
more sunny than those of his cousin. “Henri has known
much trouble,” she said.</p>

<p>“He always gets out of his troubles on the right side,” returned
Emile. “He passed unscathed through that terrible
Moscow campaign, which slew its tens of thousands, and ruined
Napoleon himself. Then he changed his religion, and took the
worst time to do it, too,&mdash;just after the return of the Bourbons
and the priests; but he only made a nine days’ wonder for all his
friends, who ended by being more attached to him than ever.
He chose a profession which every one thought beneath his
birth and his talents, and he is likely to find a career and a
fortune in it. Finally, he is affianced to a beautiful young
lady, with excellent prospects.”</p>

<p>“You amaze me, Emile,” said Clémence with a changing
colour. “Who is it?”</p>

<p>“Some one you know very well. Guess,” returned Emile,
with a cheerfulness which Clémence thought a little forced.</p>

<p>As she paused for a moment before replying, he continued,
like one in haste to finish the story, “I may as well tell you at
once. It is Mademoiselle de Sartines.”</p>

<p>“<em>Stéphanie!</em>” Clémence exclaimed. “She is only a child.”</p>

<p>“She is a very beautiful young lady,” said Emile with
emphasis. Going towards the window, he observed, “I am
surprised to see so much snow on the ground at this season.
Does it always linger so long?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
“No; this spring is an unusually late one,” Clémence
answered mechanically, while her thoughts were busy with
matters far more interesting. An electric flash passed through
her mind, linking together scattered hints, and transient, half-suppressed
allusions. The boyish quarrels of Emile with clever
little Stéphanie used to be the amusement of the household; and
that a serious attachment had sprung out of them was not by
any means improbable. A genuine compassion for her cousin
awoke within her.&mdash;And Henri? So far as he was concerned,
surprise as yet swallowed up every other feeling.</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried Emile with a brightening face, “here is Prince
Ivan alighting from his drosky. I will go and meet him;” and
he hastened from the room.</p>

<p>Emile was not demonstrative; but a warm and genuine
friendship for Ivan had a place in his heart since the day when
the young Russian answered his scoffs with generous words of
counsel and expostulation. Ivan’s advice and influence had
saved him from much evil, and Ivan’s character had unconsciously
become his model of excellence.</p>

<p>But they had scarcely exchanged salutations when several
guests came in also to share the family dinner. It was the
habit of the “grands seigneurs” of St. Petersburg to hoist a flag
over their palaces when they intended dining at home, as a sign
that their friends would be welcome to join them; and Ivan
adopted the hospitable customs of his class, while he avoided
much of its lavish and ostentatious expenditure. His guests
however departed early, as most of them were going to a ball
at Gateschina, the residence of the Empress Mother; and after
a whispered word to Clémence he said to Emile, “No doubt you
smoke, as of old? I have a smoking-room for my friends,
though I am not myself a votary of the fragrant weed. Come
with me.”</p>

<p>Emile was soon stretched at full length on a velvet-covered
divan, and accommodated with a long amber-tipped pipe filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
with the choicest tobacco. Ivan seated himself by the fire, and
the friends talked together of many things; nor was their communion
hindered by the fact that each had a secret care in his
heart. Some things were said, or hinted, by Emile which Ivan
rejoiced to hear. It soon became evident that the man was not
the scoffing sceptic the lad had been: Ivan’s words of counsel
had gone home to his heart and been the means of keeping him
from those “paths of the destroyer” into which there was once
terrible danger his feet might wander.</p>

<p>After many other subjects had been discussed, Emile observed,
“I am curious to know what you have been doing with the
Army of Occupation, since its return from France.”<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<p>“It is difficult to know what to do with it,” Ivan admitted
candidly. “Our enormous military forces threaten to become a
perplexity, now that a European peace, which God grant may
be enduring, renders them superfluous.”</p>

<p>“I should think that army of yours something worse than a
perplexity,” said Emile laying aside his pipe, “at least to the
Czar.” His tone was so ominous that Ivan looked at him
anxiously.</p>

<p>“I knew in Paris many of your countrymen, ‘Messieurs les
officiers russe’ we used to call them,” Emile resumed after a
pause. “You remember, Prince Ivan, what an ardent Imperialist
I used to be; and I think still that the exile of St. Helena
would make a better ruler for France than any effete Bourbon
or Orleans of them all. I should have plunged madly into the
wildest intrigues of the secret societies of Paris had not a
decanter of poisoned wine stopped me at the beginning.”</p>

<p>“Poisoned wine, Emile? Oh yes&mdash;I remember.”</p>

<p>“But do you remember the lecture you read me with that
poisoned wine for a text?&mdash;To use assassination as a weapon
against political foes is abominable, and all those who do so are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
cowardly villains! The murder of the Duc de Berri shows to
what a length those knights of the dagger and pistol are prepared
to go, and ought to frighten all honest people away from
their intrigues. I am sorry to say, Prince Ivan, the army that
has come back to you from France is deeply tainted with the
spirit that has prompted such crimes. Most of your officers are
members of secret societies; and the wildest talk is rife amongst
them. I have heard it said, by one who ought to know, that
it would have been better for the Czar to drown his fine army
in the Baltic than to bring it back to his own country.”</p>

<p>Ivan grew visibly pale, but suppressed the emotion he felt.
“The Czar is quite aware of the existence of these secret societies;
he knows, too, that they have extended ramifications even in
Russia,” he said. “But have you any idea, Emile, from so
much of their talk as may have reached your ears, what it is
that these gentlemen really want?”</p>

<p>“Scarcely more than they have themselves, I dare say,”
Emile answered with a rather bitter laugh. “I suppose they
would tell you, if you were admitted to their councils, that
they want a constitution for Russia.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a constitution?”</p>

<p>“Oh, every one differs as to that. I have heard it said that
every Russian officer carries a constitution about in his pocket.
I suppose, for the most part, they are like those constitutions of
revolutionary France, which were excellent on paper, only they
would not ‘march.’”</p>

<p>“And, of course, every one of these gentlemen expects the
Czar to satisfy his own particular aspirations. Suppose he fail
to do it?”</p>

<p>“Suppose he fail to do it&mdash;” Instead of finishing his sentence,
Emile heaved a long and bitter sigh, flung the ashes out
of his pipe, sat up, and gazed sadly into the fire. Presently he
resumed: “The iniquities of Alexander are twofold. He has
not, as yet, bestowed upon Russia a perfect liberal constitution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
as new and as faultless as a louis d’or fresh from the mint;
and he has used, and is using, his enormous influence to repress
in other countries the party of progress,&mdash;or of revolution, which
you will,&mdash;such as the insurgents of Spain and the Carbonari of
Italy. He even hesitates to assist the Greeks, who, by the
way, seem really to deserve assistance and compassion.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” cried Ivan with excitement, “there indeed the Czar’s
perplexity is great. Every true Russian longs to trample in
the dust that abominable Ottoman tyranny&mdash;cruel, cowardly,
treacherous as it is&mdash;and to deliver our suffering fellow-Christians,
from whom there is going up daily to the throne of God
‘the cry of the oppressed that have no comforter; and on the
side of their oppressors there is power, but they have no comforter.’
Need I tell you that the first of Russians longs for it
more than any of his subjects? But hitherto it could only have
been done at the price of another European war. And even
then it might have been done in vain.”</p>

<p>“Why so?” asked Emile.</p>

<p>“Because unless the Czar had a fleet in readiness to support
his army, every Christian in Greece might be massacred before
our troops could reach Constantinople.”</p>

<p>“His position is a difficult one,” said Emile.</p>

<p>“<em>Difficult?</em>” Ivan repeated with a heavy sigh. “Would it
were <em>only</em> difficult! Sometimes it seems to me as if his way
were so hedged about that it is impossible for him to do anything
at all. First look abroad, upon the perplexed field of
European politics. There his unceasing efforts to maintain the
peace of the world have already cost him dear. While he
endeavours with the one hand to repress the spirit of lawlessness
and anarchy, he is trying with the other to move the ‘powers
that be’ in the direction of justice, mercy, and moderation; and
consequently he is misunderstood by both. Liberals revile him
as a friend of tyrants, a renegade from the cause of freedom;
princes accuse him of opening the flood-gates before the torrent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
of democracy, and say he has none but himself to thank if his
own dominions are overwhelmed. Then look at home. <em>There</em>
is raging the conflict of religious opinion; Photi, Seraphim,
and zealots of their type, are for ever besieging his ear with
the accusation that his own hands have undermined the
Church of his country by giving his people the Scriptures in
the vulgar tongue, and the education necessary to read them.
<em>There</em> are going forward the plots and intrigues of the active,
unscrupulous secret societies: if he tolerates these as the pardonable
follies of harmless enthusiasts, he may be as one who
stands idly watching the conflagration which will consume his
own dwelling; if he allows Aratchaief and Miloradovitch to repress
them with rigour, he will assuredly be execrated as a despot.
Nor do his difficulties end here. The corruption that has eaten
like a canker into every part of the administration of this
enormous empire is the worst and sorest of them all. We are
still but half civilized. Great as are the strides we have
made, and are making, in the path of improvement, the faults
of semi-barbarism cling to us yet. In the reign of the Empress
Catherine everything was bought and sold, as too many things
are even now&mdash;in bitter shame and sorrow I say it. ‘That they
may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the
judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth his
mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.’ When these things
reach the ear of the Czar, he visits them with swift, sharp
punishment; and so men begin to call stern, hard, and suspicious
the tenderest hearted man that ever walked God’s
earth. Yet he cannot stay the evil.”</p>

<p>“God help him!” said Emile.</p>

<p>“Amen,” responded Ivan. He seemed about to add something
more; but with a look of sadness very foreign to his
bright young face he checked himself, and kept silence.</p>

<p>“When did you see him last?” asked Emile.</p>

<p>“I saw him to-day,” said Ivan briefly. There the conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
ended: Ivan shortly afterwards accompanied his friend to his
apartment, bade him a cordial good-night, and then went at
once to the dressing-room, where Clémence was awaiting him,
and reading meanwhile the letters Emile had given her.</p>

<p>The accounts of Stéphanie were particularly interesting to
her. How the approbation of that young lady’s guardian had
ever been obtained by a suitor who had so small a portion of
this world’s goods to offer as Henri de Talmont, was certainly
a mystery. The letters only solved it indirectly. That of
Madame de Talmont was the most satisfactory. She observed
that the will of Stéphanie’s guardian was very weak, while that
of Stéphanie herself was remarkably strong. When M. de
Galmar informed her of Henri’s proposal, adding, as a matter
of course, that he would decline it for her, she was far too
decorous and well-bred to make the smallest objection; but she
told him very quietly that she had often thought of embracing a
religious life, and that as her friend Madame de Krudener was
now about to found a missionary community&mdash;she believed
among the Tartars on the Danube&mdash;she wished to signify her
intention of joining it as soon as she came of age. “Your
cousin is a strange girl,” M. de Galmar observed afterwards to
his daughter Coralie. “But, after all, a Protestant is not as
bad as a Tartar. Nor is dining upon three courses, instead of
twelve, quite as bad as being dined upon oneself by cannibals
in some of those savage countries. She had better take the
young architect.”</p>

<p>Clémence looked up from her letter with an air of amusement,
which changed into one of grave anxiety as she saw the serious
face of Ivan bending over her. She drew a chair for him near
the fire, and said, “I am longing to hear all, Ivan. Why did
the Czar send for you? How did you find him?”</p>

<p>Ivan answered the last question first: “Looking depressed
and weary, and his deafness more apparent than ever. I had to sit
quite close to him, and to raise my voice to make him hear. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
spoke very mournfully of the state of things in Siberia, whence
the Governor-General, Speranski, has just returned, bringing
sad accounts of the prevalence of corruption and dishonesty in
the public service. For the present the vigorous measures of
Speranski have checked these evils, though at the expense of removing
the governor from every province save one. He has sent
these unfaithful governors here for their trial; and most of them
will probably be sent back to Siberia as convicts. But now his
own health has broken down, and he is obliged to quit his post.
There is need&mdash;great need&mdash;of faithful and active men to continue
and carry out the reforms he has begun.”</p>

<p>Here Ivan paused, took the hand of Clémence in his, and
with a look full of tenderness continued his narrative&mdash;“The
Czar said to me sadly, ‘There are so few that I can trust. Will
<em>you</em> help me in this thing, Prince Ivan Ivanovitch?’”</p>

<p>Clémence started, and her sweet face glowed with a sudden
colour, then grew pale again as rapidly. “<em>O Ivan!</em>” she
exclaimed. “And what did you say to him?”</p>

<p>“What <em>could</em> I say? Is it amongst things possible&mdash;conceivable&mdash;that
my Czar should ask me to help him, and be refused?”</p>

<p>“No; nor that I should wish it. But, Ivan, this will bring
a great change into our happy life.”</p>

<p>“These were nearly his own words. He was very kind, he
was even tenderly considerate for me and for you, Clémence.
He would not, he said, ask from me more than a few years of
my life. And for that time, could not your mother come to
you?”</p>

<p>“Come to <em>me</em>?” Clémence repeated a little proudly. “Does
he&mdash;or do you&mdash;suppose for one moment I would let you go to
Siberia alone?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he does,” Ivan answered with a dawning smile
upon his serious face. “He added, that should you prefer
accompanying me, which indeed was what he expected, every
possible comfort and luxury should be provided for you and for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
the children. ‘A residence in Siberia is not so great a hardship
as many men think,’ he said. Still, Clémence, I tremble
for our children. They are so young and tender.”</p>

<p>“Children born in St. Petersburg are not likely to suffer
much from the severity of any climate short of that of the
North Pole,” returned Clémence cheerfully. “God has made
our way plain before us, Ivan. We cannot hesitate.”</p>

<p>“So I told the Czar. He would have given me time to
reflect, but I said it was needless. I knew that in this I was
doing no wrong to you, Clémence, since your heart ever beats in
mine.”</p>

<p>“Did he say anything about the time of our departure?”</p>

<p>“Only that the summer is before us now, and that we must
not lose it. He spoke with much feeling of the Siberian
exiles, and also of the native tribes which are still heathen, and
of the missionary work going on amongst them. He said that
where he is sending me I would find many ways of promoting
the kingdom of Christ.”</p>

<p>“How did you answer him?”</p>

<p>“Just as I should have answered <em>you</em>, Clémence;&mdash;but such
words do not bear repeating. I said something about the joy
of winning souls for Christ, and I shall never forget the sudden
brightening of his sad face as he responded&mdash;‘You are young
now, but if after a long life of labour you should only succeed
in leading one sinner to Christ, you will have reason to bless
God, and to rejoice at it throughout eternity.’”<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>There were tears in the eyes of Clémence as she said, “He is
right, dearest. We will go bravely and cheerfully, in the name
of our God; for has He not said, ‘My presence shall go with
thee, and I will give thee rest’?”</p>

<span class="smcap1 f">Five</span> years have passed away. To Ivan they have
been years of toil and conflict, and yet happy
years. In the land of his exile he has laboured
earnestly to introduce order, good government,
civilization, and, above all, to sow the seeds of Christianity. A
district, or “circle,” in the north-east of Siberia, immense in
extent, but sparely peopled, has been his charge; and he has
had to travel many a weary league over snow and ice, and
through dense forests of pine and larch. In order that every
portion of the wide area intrusted to his care might enjoy the
careful personal superintendence indispensable to its prosperity,
he established his head-quarters, for six months or a year at a
time, in the different settlements within his circle, and thence
he made journeys through the surrounding districts.</p>

<p>Clémence seconded all his efforts; and her wise and loving
ministrations made each of her temporary homes a little spot of
light amidst the darkness. In selecting the numerous retinue
who accompanied him from Europe, Ivan had endeavoured to
make choice of the persons best fitted to aid him in his philanthropic
labours for the improvement of his people. The most
useful of these were the able and energetic German, Dr. Krausekopf;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
and Pope Yefim, the friend of his youth, and one of
the earliest fruits of the Evangelical revival in Russia. He
was now the sole chaplain of the household, since the venerable
Grandpierre had gone to his rest, and Clémence did not desire
a successor of the Roman Catholic faith. Ivan found him a
zealous and devoted helper, especially in missionary work.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the cheerful prophecies of Clémence about the
children had been amply fulfilled. They grew in strength and
beauty as well and as quickly as they could have done beneath
the beams of a southern sun. Alexander and Feodor had now
a little fair-haired brother Henri to play with and take care of,
and, to their great delight, a baby sister also to admire and
caress. She had recently been baptized by the name of Victoire,
because, as Clémence said, “the eldest daughter of the House
of Talmont used always to be called Victoire.”</p>

<p>A winter of very unusual severity, which surprised Ivan and
his household in one of the most northerly settlements of his
circle, for the first time since he left Europe cut him off completely
for some months from the world of civilization. Towards
the end of January violent snow-storms set in, continuing for
weeks with little intermission, and rendering impassable the
poor apologies for roads which were all that he as yet had
been able to construct. So the great fast before Easter found
him still sending out fatigue parties to clear the paths, and
watching anxiously for the first adventurous sledger who should
make his way across the fields of ice and snow with despatches
from Tobolsk.</p>

<p>Easter eve came at last; and still isolation and solitude
reigned at Novoi Nicolofsky,&mdash;as Ivan, in memory of his early
home, had named this settlement, of which he was the founder.
The short day had closed; and Ivan, robed in furs from head
to foot, came in from his manifold labours to enjoy a quiet half-hour
with Clémence. He was now about two-and-thirty, and
looked even older; for thought and toil and the habit of command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
had set their seal upon his broad, open forehead. Yet he
had lost nothing of his frank, cheerful air; and when he flung
off his furs, and seated himself at the fire by the side of
Clémence, they looked as handsome and as happy a couple as
could have been found in any land or clime.</p>

<p>With a smile of welcome Clémence laid aside her work&mdash;a
little pair of reindeer-skin moccasins. “I am glad you
have come so early, Ivan,” she said. “We can have a few
minutes’ quiet talk before we go down to the church to
listen to the reading. How pleasant it is to keep, here in the
far north, our dear Russian custom of the Easter evening Bible
reading!”</p>

<p>“Yes; our little church is crowded to-night. I have just
been looking in. Vanka the huntsman was reading the story
of our Lord’s Passion according to St. John, and I saw many a
tearful face and heard many a sob in the stillness. I meant to
have read for them myself, but I would not disturb him. I
can read by-and-by, when we go there together.”</p>

<p>“What a beautiful custom it is, this reading of God’s Word
for his brethren by any poor man who is able to do it!” said
Clémence. “Where is Pope Yefim?”</p>

<p>“In his own room, I believe. You know that on Easter eve
our priests usually leave the churches to the people.”</p>

<p>“The poor lads who are out on duty miss something.”</p>

<p>“True; but they will have their turn by-and-by. We all
must miss something,” he added, smiling. “But then we all
have our compensations.”</p>

<p>“I think the want of tidings from our dear ones is our only
<em>real</em> trial,” Clémence answered. “I sometimes long to see my
mother’s face, Ivan, and to show her our darlings. What a
happy little visit that was which she paid us in St. Petersburg
before we left! But for that I should have felt the long
separation far more.”</p>

<p>“It was very good of her to come such a distance on such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
short notice; and it sent us on our way with lightened hearts.
And does not the thought that Henri is at Tobolsk help to
break the sense of separation?”</p>

<p>“Really it does: compared with Paris, or even with St.
Petersburg, Tobolsk seems close at hand.”</p>

<p>“How well he is getting on there, too,” said Ivan. “In a
year or two, God willing, he may settle near us in Moscow or
in St. Petersburg; and our dear mother can then divide her
time between her son and daughter.”</p>

<p>“What a happy dream!” said Clémence. “And yet <em>not</em> a
dream, but a sober, practicable plan, a hope that may soon be
realized. How good God is to us, Ivan!”</p>

<p>A handsome boy of eight or nine bounded into the room, his
fair hair streaming over his fur jacket, and his bright face
glowing with exercise and excitement. “Softly&mdash;softly, my
boy,” said his father.</p>

<p>“Papinka, they are coming!&mdash;they are coming!” he shouted,
confident that the importance of his tidings justified any amount
of haste and clamour in their delivery.</p>

<p>“Who are coming, my dear boy?”</p>

<p>“Sledges, papinka, sledges! Three of them!” he cried
breathlessly. “From the south!”</p>

<p>“Do not let us be too sure,” Ivan said quickly to Clémence.
“They may be only, after all, from some neighbouring settlement.”</p>

<p>“They are from the south, papinka,” the boy repeated.
“They have signal-flags. Matvei saw them in the moonlight,
quite plainly.”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> must see them too,” said Ivan, hastily putting on his furs
again.</p>

<p>It was true. Their long isolation was over. Tidings and
letters and friends from the outer world had reached them at
last. Much more and better&mdash;Clémence sprang forward with a
cry of joy as a rough, sealskin-coated figure entered the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
“Is it thou,&mdash;is it really <em>thou</em>, Henri?” she asked between
smiles and tears.</p>

<p>“Yes, my own sweet sister, it is I,” said Henri de Talmont.
“My work in Tobolsk is finished, so I have come to visit
you.”</p>

<span class="smcap1 a">Although</span> the fast of Easter eve is the strictest
known in the Greek Church, yet on this occasion
willing hands quickly prepared a meal for the
travellers, since, as Pope Yefim observed, “Mercy is
better than sacrifice.” Whilst Ivan’s retainers took care of the
companions of Henri, he himself was waited upon like a prince
by Clémence and Ivan in person, with the assistance of Pope
Yefim and little Alexander. In reply to their eager inquiries,
he told them the incidents of his journey, which had not been
without its dangers and vicissitudes. But, through all that
he said, Clémence thought she perceived the shadow of some
great sorrow. Her foreboding heart turned at once to what
was to both of them equally and intensely dear. Three times
she tried to shape the inquiry, “Henri, how is our mother?”
and three times the words died upon her lips. But at last she
summoned courage to ask the question.</p>

<p>His answer relieved her at once: “Never better, thank God.
Such at least is her own report. I bring you letters from her,
which she enclosed to me.”</p>

<p>Then her anxious thoughts turned to his betrothed, the bright,
brave-hearted Stéphanie; but she shrank from uttering her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
name, lest haply it might have become, for him, the saddest
sound upon earth. Ivan, however, had no such misgivings,
and approached the subject gaily. “Remember, mon ami,”
he said, “we are all impatience to hear of la fiancée, la belle
Stéphanie.”</p>

<p>“I wish you could <em>see</em> her,” answered Henri brightening.
“I do not think any one could deny <em>now</em> that she is surpassingly
beautiful&mdash;and good. She finds all her recreation, all
her delight in works of love and mercy. Wherever she goes,
her energy and vivacity open the doors wide before her. And
then her sound practical sense and loving spirit make her
more than welcome.”</p>

<p>“I knew it would be so,” said Clémence. “I knew my little
friend Stéphanie would grow into a noble woman.”</p>

<p>“You are a fortunate man, Henri,” Ivan added. “How
happy we shall be together when you bring your bride and
settle amongst us! You must always spend your summers at
Nicolofsky. But now it is <em>my</em> turn,” he said lightly, as he
rose and stood beside him, laying his hand on his shoulder.
“You must tell me the last tidings of my Czar. I am thirsting
to hear of him, and not once have you named him yet.”</p>

<p>Henri paused a moment; then he said, in a low, quiet voice,
“He is well&mdash;<em>very</em>.”</p>

<p>Clémence looked up surprised, but Ivan observed nothing.
“Tell me more,” he went on eagerly. “Where was he when
you heard last? What has he been doing?&mdash;There is one thing
I long, yet scarcely hope, to hear. Has he won the desire of
his heart? Are the serfs free yet?”</p>

<p>“The serfs are <em>not</em> free;&mdash;but, dear Ivan, your Czar <em>has</em>
won the desire of his heart.”</p>

<p>Now first his tone arrested Ivan, who looked at him amazed.
“How?” he faltered, with a face growing rapidly white.</p>

<p>“Be calm, dear friend. Alexander has but exchanged the
crown of Russia for one more glorious.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
At that moment little Alexander rushed in weeping.
“Father, mother,” he sobbed, “they are all saying the Czar is
dead&mdash;the dear, good Czar, my godfather. Father, is it true?”</p>

<p>Ivan did not answer. No word passed his lips, no cry;
he only tottered and sank as one struck by a fatal bullet.
From Clémence just then his white death-like face shut out all
sorrows, all losses far away.</p>

<p>But the strong man wrestled with his agony and overcame.
After a few terrible moments, during which life changed its
aspect to Ivan Pojarsky, he regained a measure of outward
calmness.</p>

<p>“Tell me all you know, Henri,” he said at last,&mdash;“<em>all</em>, from
the beginning.”</p>

<p>The sorrow-stricken group drew close together. Clémence
had placed her hand in that of her husband, and was watching
him with anxious eyes. The weeping child stood beside his
father’s knee; and the aged priest covered his face to hide the
emotion he could not restrain.</p>

<p>“I have one fear, too dreadful to utter,” said Ivan with
pale lips. “Can you guess, and remove it, Henri?”</p>

<p>“I can. No hand touched him, except the hand of God.
It will be written in history that the Emperor Alexander died
of fever, at Taganrog in the Crimea.”</p>

<p>“Will it not be true?” asked Clémence.</p>

<p>“Not all the truth. Before the fiery shaft of the fever
smote him he was already stricken, I think to death.”</p>

<p>“Ever fearless, he was wont to brave the danger of infection
as readily as other dangers,” Pope Yefim said.</p>

<p>“My life witnesses to that,” returned Henri, almost losing
his self-control. After a pause he resumed: “Before I left
Tobolsk, I met an Englishman who had seen his physician, Dr.
Wylie, and heard from his lips a full account of every particular.
He told me all. And this, indeed, is what has brought
me here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
“It was so good of you to come,” said Clémence tearfully.</p>

<p>“He was looking ill when we parted,” Ivan said. “Ill and
worn. But he was so strong, and only forty-three. I never
dreamed of death for him&mdash;never once.”</p>

<p>Henri answered sadly: “During the years that passed since
then, those who loved him have thought of it often&mdash;have
sometimes almost <em>wished</em>”&mdash;but his voice failed; to end <em>that</em>
sentence was beyond his power. After a pause he resumed:
“Repeated attacks of erysipelas wore out his strength,&mdash;especially
one, desperately severe, two years before the end. He
never fully recovered from its effects. His nerves were shattered;
sleep forsook him; he could not bear light or noise, even
the taper which burned all day on his table to seal his never-ending
despatches, had to be carefully shaded. Still he toiled
on, rising sometimes as early as half-past three, and allowing
himself no time for rest, except such as he could snatch in his
rapid journeys, often over rough roads and in bad vehicles. One
who had a post in his household,<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> said to my English friend,
‘After two or three days passed in a carriage the uncrowned
traveller gives himself up to rest and refreshment, but the
Emperor relaxes himself from one fatigue by another. A
regiment is reviewed, government officials received, military
colonies visited, an establishment created, plans examined, and
so forth. Sleep and food have great trouble to glide into the
leisure of so busy a life.’ Yet, after all, it is not toil which
usually strikes at the roots of a strong man’s life. Nor is
bodily suffering the hardest thing to endure. ‘The spirit of a
man will sustain his infirmity, but a wounded spirit who can
bear?’ Again to use words other than my own, and all too
sadly true, ‘He saw his noble desires abandoned to ridicule,
and those to whom he devoted himself rewarded him with
ingratitude; until at last the silent but unceasing struggle he
had to maintain against those who pretended to second him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
only to paralyze his action, and to enter into his views only
that they might the better betray them, filled his days with
bitterness, and eventually shortened their course.’”<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>“Ah!” said Ivan with a shuddering sigh that was more
than half a groan of pain.</p>

<p>“The shadows fell ever dark and darker over that grand,
silent, solitary life&mdash;how dark those who stood outside could
only guess,” Henri went on. “He bore his burden alone.
Now and then a few sad words falling from his lips almost
unawares, or perhaps a look, showed what was passing within.
Once a valued friend, a lady, asked of him a favour which in
justice to others he could not grant. He couched his refusal,
as he was wont to do, in terms so gentle that she was greatly
touched; and when they parted she expressed her earnest wishes
for his happiness. At the word ‘happiness’ a change passed
over his face, and he turned away with a sorrowful gesture.
In one of his rapid journeys, his favourite aide-de-camp, Volkonski,
was his companion. The road was bad; and in ascending
a steep hill the carriage stopped, the horses being
unable to draw it. Instead of awakening Volkonski, who had
fallen asleep, the Emperor himself got out and gave the coachman
the necessary assistance, helping to push the carriage up
the hill. As he resumed his place, Volkonski awoke. ‘Ah,
sire, why did you not call me?’ he said. ‘It is all right,’
returned the Czar. ‘You were asleep, and sleep is too precious
to be disturbed,’&mdash;adding in a lower tone, as if to himself, ‘It
brings forgetfulness.’”</p>

<p>“How like him!” said Clémence.</p>

<p>“Too sadly like him,” resumed Henri. “It was all Alexander&mdash;the
unselfishness, the profound melancholy, the reserve
that only betrayed it unconsciously in taking thought for
another. But I suppose the most direct disclosure he ever
made was in a few words spoken to an old and intimate friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
who asked about his health. ‘In body, I am well,’ he answered;
‘but in mind I suffer always, and my suffering is the greater
because I cannot speak of it.’”</p>

<p>There was a pause. Clémence bent down over the fair head
of her little son to hide the tears which were dropping slowly.
“My child had better go to his rest,” she said.</p>

<p>The child’s eager face was upturned, and the request to stay
was on his trembling lips, when Ivan interposed. “No,” he
said. “Let him hear all, Clémence. He has the right.&mdash;But,
Henri, was there no one near to ask whence all this anguish
and sorrow of heart?”</p>

<p>“Some at least of its hidden sources were not hard to guess.
Had he not tasted all the bitterness of failure&mdash;worse a thousand
times than the bitterness of death? Which of all the
plans, the hopes that his soul hung upon, had found its fulfilment?
Which had not disappointed him? The Holy Alliance
had become the tool of selfish politicians, perhaps even the
instrument of tyrants. The dissemination of the Holy Scriptures,
from which he hoped so much, had proved, <em>apparently</em>, a
cause of discord and confusion; his people, so loved and toiled
for, had ‘shown themselves insensible to the benefits he sought
to confer upon them;’ and secret societies and plots for his
assassination had answered his unceasing efforts to do them
good. Well might he say, with one of old, ‘I have laboured in
vain; I have spent my strength for nought and in vain.’
And with another, ‘Now, O Lord, take away my life; for I
am not better than my fathers.’”</p>

<p>“But oh, Henri,” asked Clémence, struggling with her tears,
“did he not know, all through, in whom he had believed? Did
not Christ, in the darkest hour, stand beside his suffering servant?”</p>

<p>Henri’s face grew sadder still. “Clémence&mdash;Ivan, must I
tell you all I <em>think</em>?” he asked.</p>

<p>“All,” said Ivan. “Keep nothing back.”</p>

<p>“Then I think the face of his Lord was hid from him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
Wherefore I cannot tell. There are secrets in His dealings
with His own with which a stranger may not intermeddle.”</p>

<p>“The evil one has fearful power,” Pope Yefim said. “How
would the great adversary, the accuser of the brethren, assault
such a noble foe, and wound and harass, since he knew he
could not destroy him!”</p>

<p>“There is no doubt he used for the purpose,” Henri continued,
“that strain of hereditary melancholy which flows
through the life-current of his race, and which might&mdash;might
have&mdash;God dealt tenderly with him, after all, though it is hard
to see it now.” After a long pause he resumed: “Even when
he walked in darkness and had no light he ceased not to trust
in the Lord, and to stay himself upon his God. In the darkest
hours his word was his comfort; and those who feared his
name, however poor or lowly, were the men he delighted to
honour. You remember doubtless, before you left St. Petersburg,
the visit of those noble-hearted philanthropists, Grellet
and Allen; and you may have heard of their interview with
the Emperor;&mdash;how the three, the great monarch and the two
obscure travellers, knelt side by side, and poured out their full
hearts to God, feeling themselves truly one in that love of
Christ which passeth knowledge. Allen saw him once more,
at Verona, when the shadows of the grave had already begun to
deepen over him. Finding him weary and oppressed with
work, the Englishman spoke of mental prayer, and said that
even in the midst of engrossing occupations a man might lift
up his heart to God. ‘It is my constant practice, and I know
not what I should do without it,’ was Alexander’s answer. To
an appeal made to him by the same friend on behalf of the
suffering and indigent Waldenses, he responded with a prompt
and sympathetic munificence which evidently had its root in
the sense that they were his brethren in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>“The last year of his life was marked by peculiar sorrows.
A terrible inundation of the Neva destroyed a great part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
St. Petersburg, and brought death and desolation to thousands
of families. While the inundation continued, he spared no
effort to rescue the perishing; and for weeks afterwards he
went every day to the homes of those who had lost their
relatives, relieving their necessities, and speaking words of
hope and comfort about the ‘city which cannot be moved.’
Then another and a deeper sorrow came to him&mdash;but of that
I will not speak.”<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p>Here the child’s clear voice broke in. “Oh, father,” he asked
wondering, “why did not God comfort him?”</p>

<p>Ivan could not answer, nor could he meet the searching gaze
of the boy’s young eyes. In broken-hearted silence he turned
away. But Henri put his arm around the child and drew him
close to him. “God <em>did</em> comfort him, at last,” he said. “The
way was rough, rough and long, but the end was peace.&mdash;That
journey to the south, from which he returned no more, was
undertaken partly for the benefit of the Empress Elizabeth,
whose health for some time had been failing. Her physicians
had recommended her to pass the winter in Germany, but she
entreated them not to separate her from her husband; and, to
avoid this separation, he fixed upon a residence for her at
Taganrog, in the Crimea, the climate being accounted favourable,
resolving to make it his own headquarters for the season.
There they spent a few quiet, restful weeks together. Elizabeth
wrote to her own family that she had never been so happy
in all her life. She drove and walked with the Emperor, who
watched over her with all the care and tenderness of which he
was so capable. Whenever he walked alone, he visited the
poor in their humble homes; and many a touching memory of
his kindness will linger long on their lips and in their hearts.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
“But that peaceful breathing space had an end too soon.
During a toilsome journey through the Crimea, filled with the
usual details of business, the deadly fever and ague smote his
frame; while, just at the same time, tidings no less deadly
reached his heart. The vaguely treasonable projects of the
secret societies had ended in a desperate and deliberate plot,
of which his own assassination was a leading feature.”</p>

<p>“<em>His</em> assassination!” cried Ivan. “Impossible! They
could <em>never</em> have done it.”</p>

<p>“So it seemed,” Henri answered. “For the deed was often
purposed, never once attempted. Still the shaft struck home.
Many of those who plotted to take his life owed all that made
their own precious to his bounty; every one of them had
received favours at his hands. ‘But what could I expect? It
is a just retribution,’ he cried, unconscious in his deafness that
he spoke aloud. ‘Almighty God, let thy judgments fall on
me alone, and not on my people!’”</p>

<p>“A just retribution?” Clémence repeated. “How was it
possible to him, even for a moment, to imagine <em>that</em>?”</p>

<p>“It could only have been possible to shattered nerves and
a mind unstrung by suffering. The remembrance of the dark
tragedy that began his reign&mdash;the thought of his father’s horrible
fate, perhaps soon to be his own&mdash;came back upon him in the
hours of pain and weakness. Moreover, a stem duty was laid
upon him. Before treason such as had been now disclosed to him
no monarch on earth could remain passive. The ruler ‘beareth
not the sword in vain.’ But to Alexander it was easier to
suffer than to strike.</p>

<p>“So he returned to Taganrog with fever in his veins and the
bitterness of death in his heart. For some days he struggled
on, refusing to yield to his ever increasing malady, and rejecting
the severe remedies his physicians pressed upon him. They
thought he wished to die; and so it may have been, still I
am persuaded he would not have thrust the cup of life aside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
by any act of his own. He really believed their treatment
mistaken. ‘My malady is beyond your skill,’ he said to
them; and again to Wylie, ‘Ah, my friend, I think you
are deceived as to the nature of my illness; it is my nerves
that need a cure.’ Wylie bore witness afterwards that throughout
those days, so sad for the watchers, and to the very end,
he ‘continued to rest upon Christ as his only hope. His greatest
pleasure was to have the Scriptures read to him; and he often
requested his attendants to leave him alone, doubtless that he
might hold communion with God in prayer.’<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>“One loving, tireless watcher scarcely quitted him night or
day. New strength seemed poured upon the feeble frame and
timid spirit of the gentle Elizabeth. Rising almost from her
own bed of sickness to watch beside his, yet she never failed,
never faltered; even in the most terrible hours of agony no
entreaties could win her from his side. And strength was
given her to the end. His last word, his last look was for her.
She had her reward.”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” murmured Clémence&mdash;“thank God!”</p>

<p>“When at last Wylie told him his danger,&mdash;‘Then you
really believe I am dying?’ he said, looking him earnestly in
the face. Wylie assented. ‘The best news I have heard for
many years,’ returned he, pressing Wylie’s hand. The Archimandrite
Fedotof was summoned to act as his confessor. Their
interview was very brief; but the priest said that ‘he had never
seen more Christian humility, or a dying man more thoroughly
prepared.’ Afterwards, with Elizabeth, he partook for the
last time of the memorials of his Saviour’s love. No doubt
Christ drew very near him then; for a look of exceeding
peace and rest came over his worn, suffering face, and he
said to Elizabeth that he had never been so happy in all his
life. Summoning the physicians again, he gently told them to
do what they pleased, he would no longer object to anything.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
But their treatment, if ever it would have availed, was worse
than useless now. Increased suffering and violent delirium
were the result. Still there were intervals of consciousness, in
which he thanked those around him for their services, spoke
to Elizabeth with the warmest gratitude and affection, and
earnestly commended her to the care of his friend Volkonski,
entreating him not to leave her until he had brought her to
his mother at St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>“Calm returned at length. It was early in the morning.
He opened his eyes, fixed them with full recognition on
the face of Elizabeth; took her hand, pressed it to his
lips and his heart; and then greeted Volkonski, who stood
beside him, with a smile. Overjoyed at the recognition,
the faithful servant bent down over the hand of his beloved
master and tried to kiss it; but Alexander had long ago forbidden
him this act of homage as too ceremonious for so dear
a friend, and now he drew his hand away with a slight, loving
gesture of reproach. The curtains had been pushed aside from
a window near the sofa where he lay, and the morning sun was
streaming brightly in. ‘Ah, le beau jour!’ he murmured with
a look of pleasure. Then looking anxiously and tenderly at
Elizabeth, ‘Que vous devez être fatiguée!’ he said. They were
his last words, although for another day and night of weakness
and suffering life lingered on. The following morning he again
knew those around him, pressed once more the hand of Elizabeth,
looked at her with expressive eyes full of affection, and
tried to speak&mdash;but in vain. Then, at last, Christ took his weary
servant home.&mdash;So you see, my child,” said Henri to the little
Alexander as he drew him closer still, “God comforted him.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence. The aged priest and the little
child were weeping bitterly, and the quiet tears of Clémence
were falling. She was the first to speak. “And Elizabeth?”
she asked softly.</p>

<p>“Elizabeth closed his eyes, knelt down beside him, and in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
few words of prayer gave him up to God. Then she added to
a letter she had already begun to the Empress Mother, ‘Our
angel is gone from us into heaven. My only comfort is that I
shall not long survive him. I hope soon to be reunited to him.’
And I think her hope will not be disappointed.”<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>Another silence, then Ivan rose slowly, as if to leave the
room. “Stay, dear Ivan,” Henri said. “I think it will comfort
you to know with what a passion of grief he is lamented.”</p>

<p>“Scarcely,” Ivan answered in a trembling voice. “In this
world love and understanding always come too late.”</p>

<p>“The long journey from Taganrog to St. Petersburg was
made amidst the tears of a sorrowing people, who paid the
precious dust every tribute of love and reverence their grateful
hearts could devise,” said Henri. “The honours the living
would never accept were heaped upon the dead. In many
places the crowds drew the funeral carriage themselves, forgetting
how he who lay there used to say he ‘could never endure
to see men doing the work of beasts of burden.’ The faithful
heart of Ilya was well-nigh broken, because, on account of
his original rank, which was that of a mujik, he who had driven
his lord for eight-and-twenty years would not be permitted to
drive him now. Nothing could separate him from the hearse;
by day he walked beside it, at night he slept beneath it,
wrapped in furs. But when he came to the capital the Grand-Duke
Nicholas allowed him once more to take the reins.</p>

<p>“In St. Petersburg, his own bright city of the Neva, the
sorrow is profound and universal. There is scarcely a family,
from the highest to the lowest, of which he has not been personally
the benefactor. The first three days after the tidings
came seemed like the three days’ darkness of Egypt. A deep,
silent gloom brooded over all. To some true hearts that loved
him the grief has proved too heavy to be borne. One such I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
know of&mdash;a merchant of retired habits, noted for his munificent
charities. He heard the tidings when walking on the Neva
Prospekt, reached his home with difficulty, uttered no words
but these, ‘The Emperor is dead,’ and expired in the midst of
his family.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> Nor is it in St. Petersburg alone that he is
missed and mourned. There is weeping in the vine-clad valleys
of France as well as on the frozen plains of Russia.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> Wherever
his armies trod he has left behind him a track of blessing.</p>

<p>“Of funeral pomp and splendour, of the outward, visible
signs of a great nation’s pride and sorrow, I have no heart to
speak. The priceless jewels of the seven crowns of Russia
which were laid upon his bier could be scarcely less to the
senseless dust than they had been to the living man.”</p>

<p>“What need of them?” Pope Yefim said. “Now he wears
the crown of glory that fadeth not away, he walks amidst the
splendours of the New Jerusalem, with its streets of gold and
gates of pearl, its walls of jasper and foundation-stones of
living fire.”</p>

<p>“He sees the face of Christ,” Henri answered; “for it is
written, ‘His servants shall serve him; they shall see his face,
and his name shall be in their foreheads.’”</p>

<span class="smcap1 i">Ivan</span> “entered into his closet, and shut his door;”
not to hold communion with his Father in heaven,
but to wrestle in solitude and silence with the
anguish of his soul. Never before had a sorrow
touched the roots of his nature, the very ground and core of
his being. He was stricken to the heart, but he was not
stunned by the blow. He had been able to hear and to comprehend
every detail; and now&mdash;far from telling himself, as men
often do in the first strangeness of a sudden grief, that this
thing was not, <em>could not</em> be, true&mdash;he felt as if he had known
it for years, as if it had already become part of his life. “The
Czar Alexander Paulovitch is dead,” said Ivan&mdash;“dead in the
very prime of his days, in the very zenith of his power and
glory.”</p>

<p>From the first hour he knew him, the soul of Ivan clave to
that of his Czar. His love for him was a passion of loyalty
and hero-worship, blended with deepest personal affection and
gratitude. And now it seemed to him that the world, from
which that grand presence had departed, was henceforward a
dull, cold, sunless world; where, indeed, there might be much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
to do and much to suffer, but which could never more be kindled
by the light of morning, by the glamour of romance. All
was changed, and changed for ever.</p>

<p>He laid before him on the table two memorials of the past
which he always wore&mdash;the Moscow medal, and the golden coin
Alexander’s hand had given him long ago by the Oka. The
medal he looked at with a sigh and put down quietly, the coin
he pressed once and again to his lips. Clearly, as though it
were but yesterday, he saw the noble form of “his boyar”&mdash;the
stately head, the young face, so full of manly beauty and
deep concern&mdash;bending compassionately over the mujik’s prostrate
form. Then, unawares, the vision changed. The low,
distant chant of sweet voices in the chapel, performing the midnight
Easter service, fell upon his ear, and turned aside the
current of his thoughts, though it could not break the isolation
of his sorrow. Instead of the banks of the Oka he saw the
vine-clad plains of France, and heard the thrilling harmony,
almost awful in its solemn majesty, of that thanksgiving service
in the Plaine des Vertus. In what joy and glory had his Czar
walked that day&mdash;so grand and peerless amongst men&mdash;so full
of lowly, reverent gladness before his Saviour and his God!</p>

<p>A flood of bitter pain swept over him. “O God!” he
cried, “why didst thou not take him thus to thyself?” If a
heroic, triumphant death had stopped him in the midst of his
career of victory, Ivan almost felt as though he could have
borne the blow. Or if God had made him to prosper in all he
put his hand to, had given him to see the glad fruition of all
his hopes and dreams, and then gently taken him, full of years
and honours, from an earthly to a heavenly crown, Ivan could
have comprehended his ways with his servant; he could have
said, “Thy will be done.”</p>

<p>He did <em>not</em> say it now. His soul rose up in rebellion, and
from its seething depths there came the bitter cry, “Was this
thy word unto thy servant, upon which thou didst cause him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
hope, ‘I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and
honour him. With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him
my salvation’?”&mdash;<em>Was</em> he satisfied? What had he gained?
Failure, disappointment, sorrow marked every step of his way.
Almost had he fainted utterly; almost had his feet stumbled on
the dark mountains, while he looked for light, and behold, darkness
and the shadow of death. Until at last, worn out and
weary, “with shattered nerves and sinews all unstrung,” and
with heart broken by the ingratitude of those he loved and
trusted, he “laid himself down in the grave and slept the sleep
of death.” “Could any death have been more sad?” cried Ivan
in his agony. “Rather would it have seemed a fitting end for
a life spent in the service of self and sin, than for one which
was laid as an offering at the feet of Christ.” Numb, blank
despair stole over his heart, and a low half-broken moan arose
from his lips&mdash;“No use in conflict, no hope of victory! The
noblest, brightest lives only end in the worst bitterness of
failure. God is great and good, and there is his heaven still to
look for; but all things here below are a dark sad mystery.
This world belongs to the powers of evil, and they prevail.”</p>

<p>Fast bound in the trance of his sorrow, he did not see the
red light of the northern morning steal slowly in. Nor did he
hear an approaching footstep, nor a gentle knock at the door;
which, however, was not fastened on the inside, so Clémence
opened it softly, and came towards him. Bending down, she
pressed upon his white lips the Easter salutation, saying,
“Christohs voskress” (Christ is risen).</p>

<p>“Voyst venno voskress” (He is risen indeed), Ivan
answered mechanically, after the beautiful custom of the
Eastern Church.</p>

<p>“My husband,” she said softly, laying her hand on his arm,
“dost thou believe it?”</p>

<p>He looked up: her face too was pale, and bore the traces
of many tears. “I <em>know</em> it to be true,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
“Do you believe it, my Ivan? Do you believe, in your
heart of hearts, that Christ has burst the bonds of death, not
for himself alone, but for all whom we love?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I believe in the resurrection of the just,” said Ivan
with trembling lips.</p>

<p>“Then why sorrow for our Czar as those that have no
hope?”</p>

<p>“Do not speak to me, Clémence. I cannot bear it yet. My
heart is breaking. Not so much because God has taken him
from us, as because of all the darkness&mdash;all the seeming failure.”</p>

<p>A still, calm smile passed over the quiet face of Clémence,
kindling it with a radiance more than that of the morning.
Ivan looked at her wondering. “What is it?” he asked,
taking her hand and drawing her to a seat beside him.</p>

<p>“<em>Christ is risen</em>,” she said again. “That word folds up within
it all comfort, Ivan.”</p>

<p>“I see no comfort now.”</p>

<p>“You will see it soon, dearest. You will see that His
resurrection from the dead&mdash;the ending of his bitter agony in
endless joy&mdash;means the resurrection of all our hopes; and
assures us for evermore that life, not death, joy not sorrow,
fruition not failure, is his purpose for all who trust him.”</p>

<p>“But how bitter the way!”</p>

<p>“Who thinks of the way when the end is won? Was the
Master’s own way an easy one, Ivan? Yet it is said, ‘He shall
see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied.’ And as
the Master, so the servant.”</p>

<p>“<em>Satisfied?</em>” Ivan repeated. “With what? Surely not
with the results of his own work. I thought God meant him
to do such great things, Clémence! Almost to bring in the
earthly reign of righteousness and peace. And I believe he
thought so too himself. It was the deepest longing of his
heart. It was what he tried to do&mdash;tried and failed.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember, Ivan, the day our little Alexander tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
so hard to make a bow&mdash;‘a real bow to shoot with,’ as he called
it? He failed in every effort, until at last he grew discouraged,
and cried bitterly, refusing to be comforted. Then <em>you</em>
came, took the wood and the knife from his hand, and made
the bow. I shall never forget his bright glad face as he stood
beside you, watching while you worked. He was so proud of
your strength and skill, and your success in doing what he
could not do; and when the bow was finished, he bore it off
triumphantly, to show every one in the settlement how well his
father made it for him. Ivan, our child’s trust and joy have
been a parable for me to-night. I seem to see him for whom
our Easter festival is turned into mourning, standing thus by
the side of Christ, in full, restful, glad content. What matter
if the work dropped unfinished from his own hand? He no
longer heeds it now. It is <em>Christ’s</em> work he is watching. He
sees Him preparing the true reign of peace and righteousness,
the grand, final victory of right over wrong, good over evil. He
is satisfied.”</p>

<p>Ivan’s sad face brightened a little. “You bring me comfort,
Clémence,” he said. “I begin to see that even failures&mdash;”</p>

<p>“<em>If</em> failures after all they were, which I doubt,” Clémence
interrupted. “Perhaps the seeds he has been sowing will spring
up in flower and fruit when not we alone, but our children too,
have gone to join him in the resting-place within the veil.
Indeed I think no real failure possible to the child of God,
except failure in trusting him.”</p>

<p>“And there he did <em>not</em> fail,” Ivan said. After a pause he
added, “Yes, there he won the victory;&mdash;and yet Christ’s victory
is more to him than his own.”</p>

<p>“As <em>his</em> glory was ever more to thee than thine, Ivan.”</p>

<p>A patter of little feet and a sound of childish voices broke in
upon their quiet talk. There was a loud shrill burst of laughter
from the baby lips of Henri, checked by low words from Alexander.
“Hush! we must not laugh loud&mdash;not <em>this</em> morning.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
Then the half-closed door was pushed open, and at once three
little voices spoke the Easter greeting&mdash;“Christohs voskress.”
Who should be the first to claim Papinka’s Easter kiss? Alexander
hung back, and putting his arm round Feodor, held him
back also, that sunny-haired little Henri might spring triumphantly
to his father’s arms, never doubting that his own active
limbs had won the race for him.</p>

<p>“Voyst venno voskress,” said Ivan, as he fondly kissed, first
the baby brother, then the two elder boys. There was magic
in the touch of those little lips to soothe the heavy sorrow at
his heart. But something in the thoughtful face of Alexander
made him draw the boy close to him. “My child has been
weeping this Easter morning,” he said.</p>

<p>For a moment the child did not speak. Then he said falteringly,
“I meant to serve the Czar, my godfather, when I grew
to be a man.”</p>

<p>“Serve instead <em>his</em> King, whom he loved,” answered Ivan.
“And take this thought with thee to keep all thy life, ‘The
Lord is <em>good</em> to the soul that seeketh him.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, father,” the boy whispered, winding his arm about his
father’s neck. “Yes, he is good; for he comforted him at
last.”</p>

<p>“He did, my child. However dark his ways with his own
may seem to be, yet are they all mercy and truth&mdash;<em>all</em>&mdash;when
we see them from the end to the beginning. ‘Though he
cause grief, yet will he have compassion.’ He will make the
heart of his own to rejoice, and that joy no man taketh from
them.”</p>

<p>“Papinka, are these our Easter gifts?” asked Feodor, laying
his rash little fingers on the silver medal and the golden coin
so temptingly near him on the table.</p>

<p>“Nay, my boy; these are too precious for thy father to give
away even to his dear little son. When he is laid in the grave,
these shall be laid there with him. But to-day, my children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
we will not talk of the grave, but of Him who came back from
it, and opened our way to the happy home beyond.”</p>

<p>So the current of those lives flowed on;&mdash;little lives of children,
like bright, glad mountain rills, laughing as they tripped
along; larger lives of thoughtful men and women, moving
towards the sea in ever broadening channels, and bearing precious
freights. Sorrow might come to them, but not despair;
conflict, but not defeat. Life to them was “a cordial Yes, and
not a dreary No,” for the same reason which makes it worth
while for each one of us to live and work to-day&mdash;because
“Christohs voskress,” Christ is risen indeed.</p>

smallest particular. The only liberty taken has been that of transferring the scene from
the bank of the Wilia to that of the Oka. The story became known in England through
a private letter, and the Royal Humane Society sent the Czar a medal&mdash;rather a singular
“decoration” for a monarch. He “accepted it with a noble and modest simplicity,”
and profited by the circumstance to introduce a similar society into his own dominions.
For the description of his personal appearance one contemporary authority amongst
many may be cited: “Malgré la régularité et la délicatesse de ses traits, l’éclat, la
fraîcheur de ses teints, sa beauté frappait moins à la première vue que cet air de bienveillance
qui lui captivait tout les cœurs, et du premier mouvement inspirait la confiance....
Il avait l’œil vif, spirituel, et couleur d’un ciel sans nuages; sa vue était un
peu courte, mais il possédait le sourire des yeux, si l’on peut appeler ainsi l’expression
de son regard bienveillant et doux.... Son front chauve, mais qui donnait à l’ensemble
de sa figure quelque chose d’ouvert et de serein, ses cheveux d’un blond doré, arrangés
avec soin comme dans les belles têtes des camées ou des médailles antiques, semblaient
faits pour recevoir la triple couronne de laurier, de myrte, et d’olivier.”</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_45" id="Footnote_45" href="#FNanchor_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> All that is told in this and the succeeding chapter about the ministrations of
Alexander to the French prisoners is strictly and circumstantially true. Sir Archibald
Alison, who well observes that Alexander terminated “a campaign of unexampled
danger and glory by deeds of unprecedented mercy,” had the details from the Emperor’s
own physicians, Wylie and Crichton, his assistants in the noble work. There are many
other sources of information from which interesting anecdotes may be gleaned. The
story of the dying Spaniard is one of these. Alexander not only took care to forward
his letter, but sought out all the other Spanish prisoners, clothed them, and sent them
home at his own expense. He described his visit to the Convent of St. Basil to a friend
in these words:&mdash;“I was there in the evening: a single lamp illumined those profound
vaults, beneath which piles of corpses had been heaped almost as high as the walls. I
cannot express the horror with which I was penetrated when amongst the dead bodies I
saw creatures moving who were yet alive.” On his way to Vilna, he took up in his own
sledge starving French soldiers whom he met with, and brought them to those whom he
could trust to take care of them, leaving money to supply their wants.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_49" id="Footnote_49" href="#FNanchor_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> A distinguished English officer, who was present, says this was the only occasion
on which he ever saw Alexander put himself personally forward; he was usually,
though only too ready to share the perils of war, careful to leave its glories to his
generals. But this was to save life.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_50" id="Footnote_50" href="#FNanchor_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> He could say all that and more with perfect truth. The conduct of Alexander
during the War of Liberation forms a very bright page in his history. He
spared no effort to infuse his own courage, energy, and determination into his allies.
At the outset, he wished for the chief command of the united armies, a position for
which he was well qualified, and to which he possessed every possible claim. But
Austrian jealousy interfered: for it must be remembered that Francis of Austria
had given his daughter in marriage to Napoleon, so that the infant heir of the
common enemy was the grandson of one of the allied sovereigns. Inspired by his
cabinet, the Austrian general, Prince Schwartzenberg, opposed the arrangement, and
Alexander quietly gave way. He appeased the indignation of the King of Prussia, and
reconciled Schwartzenberg with him. He broke up his own enormous armies into
auxiliary corps, most of which he placed under the command of his allies; and abandoning
the lower ambition of being the nominal head of the confederation, contented
himself with being its soul and its inspiring genius. It was he who planned, and
urged upon his allies, the march upon Paris that brought the war to a successful
termination.</p></div>
